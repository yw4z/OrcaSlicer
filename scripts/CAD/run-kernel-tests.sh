# Headless CAD-kernel test loop. THE verification contract for delegated work:
# exit 0 means the kernel builds and the selected Catch2 tags pass. Nothing else counts.
#
# Builds only the `libslic3r_tests` target (not the GUI app), so a round trip is
# minutes, not tens of minutes. Needs no display: every [CadDocument] case builds a
# CadDocument, recompute()s it and asserts on geometry.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/CAD/run-kernel-tests.sh                        # [CadDocument] tags, default volume
#   scripts/CAD/run-kernel-tests.sh --tags '[CadDocument],[Sketch]'
#   scripts/CAD/run-kernel-tests.sh --vol wt_mirror        # private build cache (parallel workers)
#   scripts/CAD/run-kernel-tests.sh --host tommaso@100.103.234.2   # build on a remote host
#
# Parallel workers MUST pass a distinct --vol: two builds sharing one cache corrupt
# each other. A new volume pays one full build; runs after that are incremental.
#
# --host exists because the deps image lives wherever it was first built. It rsyncs this
# working tree to a per-volume staging dir on that host and re-runs this same script
# there, so the verification contract is identical either way. Drop --host once the image
# is present locally.
# Rig build traps already paid for once each (stale project, NLopt cache, pybind11, OCCT_LIBS, SLIC3R_CAD gate): docs/rig_build_traps.md

# No exclusions. Both cases that used to be quarantined now run: the solver SIGABRT on
# circle-line tangency is fixed (tkz), and the internal-thread case turned out to have
# correct geometry and a wrong reference in the test (kzy). A green run here now means
# the whole CAD suite passed, not "everything except the two we gave up on".
#
# ...and that claim was still not true, because the default tag was [CadDocument] alone while
# four CAD test files carry their own tags and NOTHING ELSE selected them. test_sketchinference
# ([inference], 15), test_sketchedit ([SketchEdit], 23), test_sketchconstraints
# ([SketchConstraints], 8) and test_sketchimport ([SketchImport], 4) never ran here, nor did the
# older [slvs]-only cases in test_slvs_constraints. Measured 2026-08-31: the default reported
# 2624 assertions / 206 cases, the full set 7648 / 264 -- so the gate was speaking for about a
# third of the assertions, and a whole file could be added, tagged by its own convention, and
# stay dark while the suite printed green. All 58 were passing; the coverage was simply never
# exercised. Adding a tag here is now part of adding a test file.

# ---- OOM guard (2026-08-21) -------------------------------------------------------------
# Two of these builds ran at once on 2026-08-21, each with ninja -j$(nproc)=16: ~36 cc1plus
# holding 42 GB of a 62 GB box -> global OOM at 21:05, a 2h28m kill storm, ssh unreachable,
# lightdm destroyed. Neither build produced a single object. scripts/CAD/build-gui.sh grew the
# bounds first; every script that starts a compile needs the same three, or the guard is only
# as strong as the script you happened not to use.
#   flock    — the lock path is SHARED with build-gui.sh and the other fork on purpose, so
#              concurrent builds serialise instead of summing.
#   -j       — bounded parallelism; ~1.17 GB per cc1plus was the measured average.
#   --memory — the actual guarantee: a runaway build dies in its own cgroup instead of taking
#              the host down. --memory-swap equal to --memory forbids swap, which is what made
#              ssh hang.
