"""Rung 9: the ladder, graded against real drawings instead of shapes I chose.

Rungs 1-8 are hand-built. That is their weakness: I wrote both the geometry and the
assertion, so they prove the engine does what I expected on cases I picked. This rung
takes a SYSTEMATIC sample of the StudyCadCam corpus (every 20th sheet, 1..996 — no
cherry-picking) and grades the engine against each drawing's OWN vector geometry,
extracted from the PDF. Nothing here is transcribed by eye; the drawing is the input.

The method: pdftocairo renders the sheet to SVG, where the drawn geometry is exactly the
stroked (fill="none") paths and the text is filled glyph paths. Beziers are flattened, so
every entity handed to the engine is a straight line and every comparison below is EXACT
— no faceting tolerance to hide behind. The closed chains are then found twice: once by
this script, in plain Python, and once by the engine. The assertions are that the two
agree, and that the engine's own operations preserve what they promise.

  CLOSED    the engine finds the same closed loops this script does
  AREA      the engine's area for each loop equals the shoelace area, to 1e-6
  VOID      the engine attributes each void to the loop that actually contains it
  MIRROR    a real closed profile, mirrored, is still exactly one closed loop
  OFFSET    a real closed profile, offset, is still closed
