"""Autonomous 2D-sketch loop: drive the Design tab's sketch layer over the MCP socket and
assert the things that decide whether a profile is buildable.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The 2D layer used to be reachable only by clicking, so every question about it
("is this loop closed?", "did the offset survive?", "is the circle a void or a second body?")
cost a GUI session and a human. The socket verbs make each one a call, and this script is the
loop: build a known profile, ask the app what it thinks it has, compare against arithmetic.

RUN IT AGAINST A RUNNING APP:
    ORCA_CAD_MCP=/tmp/mcp.sock <binary>          # launch with the socket enabled
    python3 scripts/CAD/check-mcp-sketch.py [socket] # default /tmp/mcp.sock

Exit 0 = every assertion held. Anything else prints the first mismatch and stops.
