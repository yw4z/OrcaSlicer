# Incremental slicer build against the orcacad-deps base image.
#
# The deps-baked image (built from scripts/Dockerfile.deps) carries the pinned
# dependencies at /OrcaSlicer/deps/build/destdir. This script mounts the LIVE source
# tree and resources over the baked copy so code/CMake edits apply immediately, and
# persists /OrcaSlicer/build in a named volume so ninja recompiles only what changed.
#
# Result: edit -> rebuild in seconds-to-minutes instead of a full Docker rebuild.
#
# Usage (run on the build host, e.g. behemoth, from anywhere):
#   scripts/CAD/build-gui-incremental.sh
#   IMAGE=orcacad-deps scripts/CAD/build-gui-incremental.sh
#
# On success the binary is inside the persistent volume at
# /OrcaSlicer/build/package/bin/orca-slicer (copy it out with a follow-up
# `docker run --rm -v orcacad_buildcache:/b alpine cp ...` or via this script's tail).
# Rig build traps already paid for once each (stale project, NLopt cache, pybind11, OCCT_LIBS, SLIC3R_CAD gate): docs/rig_build_traps.md

# The root CMakeLists.txt and cmake/ must be mounted too, not taken from the baked image:
# they carry the build-time gates (e.g. SLIC3R_CAD -> add_definitions(-DSLIC3R_CAD)) that the
# mounted headers are compiled against. With a stale baked copy the gate silently stays off and
# the build fails with "class GLCanvas3D has no member named set_design_sketch_tool".
#
# build_linux.sh must be mounted for the same reason, and here the stale copy is guaranteed
# wrong rather than merely risky: orcacad-deps is layered on snapmaker-deps, so the baked script
# is the OTHER fork's and builds `--target Snapmaker_Orca`. This fork's target is `OrcaSlicer`,
# so without this mount configure succeeds and then ninja dies on "unknown target".
# scripts/ likewise: build_linux.sh's packaging step sources scripts/appimage_lib_policy.sh,
# which the baked Snapmaker tree does not have, so a fully successful link still exited
# non-zero with "missing AppImage helper" and the binary check never ran.

# ---- OOM guard (2026-08-21) -------------------------------------------------------------
# Two of these builds ran at once on 2026-08-21, each with ninja -j$(nproc)=16: ~36 cc1plus
# holding 42 GB of a 62 GB box -> global OOM at 21:05, a 2h28m kill storm, ssh unreachable,
# lightdm destroyed. Neither build produced a single object. scripts/CAD/build-gui.sh grew the
# bounds first; every script that starts a compile needs the same three, or the guard is only
# as strong as the script you happened not to use.
#   flock    — the lock path is SHARED with build-gui.sh and the other fork on purpose, so
#              concurrent builds serialise instead of summing.
#   -j       — bounded parallelism; ~1.17 GB per cc1plus was the measured average.
#   --memory — the actual guarantee: a runaway build dies in its own cgroup instead of taking
#              the host down. --memory-swap equal to --memory forbids swap, which is what made
#              ssh hang.
