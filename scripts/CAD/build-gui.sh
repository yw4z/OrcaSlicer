# NEVER build inside the GUI container (snapmaker-gui / orcacad-gui). Its baked /OrcaSlicer tree
# is the Jun-13 Snapmaker-derived source, so a `cmake .` in there silently reconfigures the
# shared build dir as project(Snapmaker_Orca) and this fork's targets vanish. That is Trap 1 of
# five; all of them, with symptoms and exact recovery commands, are in docs/rig_build_traps.md.
# Read that file before debugging a configure or link failure this script reports.

# Usage:
#   scripts/CAD/build-gui.sh              # configure + build the fork's GUI target
#   DRY_RUN=1 scripts/CAD/build-gui.sh    # print the resolved fork identity and exit, no container

# Three memory bounds. On 2026-08-21 both forks ran this script at the same time, each with
# ninja -j$(nproc)=16: ~36 cc1plus holding 42 GB of a 62 GB box -> global OOM at 21:05, a
# 2h28m kill storm, ssh unreachable, lightdm destroyed, 2946 session kill events. Neither
# build produced a single object. The bounds, weakest to strongest:
#   flock    — the lock path is shared by both forks on purpose, so they SERIALISE instead of
#              summing. Peak is one build's worth no matter who else starts one.
#   -j12     — measured 1.17 GB average per cc1plus in the incident dump, so 12 in flight
#              is ~14 GB typical and leaves the box usable. JOBS=n overrides.
#   --memory — the actual guarantee. A runaway build hits its own cgroup limit and dies alone;
#              the host never reaches global OOM again, whatever -j or flock do.
#              --memory-swap equal to --memory forbids swap, which is what made ssh hang.

# Every one of these mounts covers a trap, none is decorative:
#   CMakeLists.txt + cmake/ carry the SLIC3R_CAD gate — inherit the baked copies and the cache
#     says SLIC3R_CAD=ON while -DSLIC3R_CAD is never defined, so every #ifdef block compiles out.
#   deps_src/ carries pybind11, which the image predates.
#   src/, resources/, localization/, version.inc are the code under test.
