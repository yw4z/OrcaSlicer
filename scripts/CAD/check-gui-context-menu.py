"""The OFFER ladder: prove that right-click is the pivot, and that it adapts to what was clicked.

The gesture ladder (scripts/CAD/check-gui-sketching.py) proved the TARGET — a complex closed profile, precise
in vertices, lengths, arcs and symmetry, with its voids correctly attributed. It proved it by
arming every tool with a letter key. That leaves the goal's own MECHANISM untested: the design
logic pivots on right-click, and the verbs offered are supposed to adapt to the element under the
cursor. Half the vocabulary is only reachable that way — 47 of 86 Design-tab verbs have a GUI
action and no shortcut, so a key-driven ladder cannot reach them at all.

This ladder drives the menu. Nothing here is asserted from pixels:

  WHAT WAS CLICKED  -> the offer's own [OFFER] trace, emitted by show_offer_menu from the same
                       loop that builds the rows (ORCA_CAD_KEYTRACE). It cannot drift from what
                       the user is shown, which a hand-written expectation list would.
  WHAT IS OFFERED   -> the same trace, compared against DesignOffer.hpp parsed independently.
                       "The menu shows exactly the verbs the table says apply here" is a
                       property; a copied list of row names is a transcription.
  WHAT IT PRODUCED  -> the MCP socket, read-only, exactly as in the gesture ladder.

Run inside the rig container, with the app launched under ORCA_CAD_KEYTRACE=1:

    docker exec orcacad-gui python3 /OrcaSlicer/scripts/CAD/check-gui-context-menu.py [rung ...]
