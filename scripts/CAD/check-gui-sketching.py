"""A ladder of sketches drawn the way a person draws them: mouse gestures and typed values.

WHY THIS EXISTS, next to scripts/CAD/check-sketch-engine.py. That ladder proves the ENGINE — it feeds
geometry through the MCP socket's add_entities_scripted and grades what comes back. The socket
path skips everything the goal actually rests on: gesture state, the auto-edit queue, snapping,
inference at gesture tolerance, and the right-click offer. A ladder that only drives the socket
cannot say the Design tab meets its goal. This one draws with synthetic clicks and types the
values into the in-canvas field, then reads the result back through the socket, which is used
here ONLY as an instrument, never as an author.

Runs INSIDE the headless rig container (Xvfb :10 + openbox + the app with ORCA_CAD_MCP set):

    docker cp scripts/CAD/check-gui-sketching.py orcacad-gui:/tmp/ && \
    docker exec orcacad-gui python3 /tmp/check-gui-sketching.py [rung ...]

# and sym_h (after "symmetric") and dist_x and dist_y (after "fix") were added while this list
# still had 14 names. Everything from index 6 on was wrong in both forks. Nothing caught it
