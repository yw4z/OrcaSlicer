# WHY THIS EXISTS. Dismissing the first-run dialogs by computing the titlebar close box from
# `xdotool getwindowgeometry --shell` and clicking it went wrong whenever the dialog had already
# closed: the eval left the geometry variables stale or empty, the click landed at a garbage
# coordinate, and it repeatedly hit the Sketch button in the toolbar underneath, so the app came up
# in sketch mode with a stray Sketch feature. Three of those in one session.
#
# The titlebar click is nevertheless the RIGHT mechanism and is kept. `xdotool windowclose` looks
# cleaner but kills the app: it destroys the GdkWindow out from under the dialog and the process
# dies with "GdkWindow unexpectedly destroyed", three GLib-GObject criticals and a segfault
# (measured 2026-07-30). Escape does not close the Setup Wizard either. So the fix is not a
# different mechanism, it is refusing to click on geometry we have not validated.
