# One turn of the keyboard-focus convergence loop, start to verdict, with no human in it.
#
#   scripts/CAD/focus-loop.sh              # full turn: sync -> build -> restart -> assert
#   SKIP_BUILD=1 scripts/CAD/focus-loop.sh # re-assert against the binary already on the host
#
# Exit 0 only when every gate holds. Any other exit is a failing gate and names which.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The focus defects in the Design tab were chased for days by hand: build, launch
# the GUI, drive it with xdotool, read a screenshot, guess, repeat. That needs a person at every
# step and it is where the days went. This does not: behemoth carries an agent-owned Xvfb :10 with
# openbox, the app, xdotool and an MCP socket that reports sketch state as JSON, so a turn is
# sync -> build -> restart -> assert, and the ASSERTION is the verdict, not my reading of a picture.
#
# WHY BEHEMOTH AND NOT THE orcacad-gui RIG CONTAINER. The rig was the obvious host and it does not
# work for this: its image pins a dependency set 216 non-CAD source files behind cad-mainline
# (assimp among them), so today's CAD sources call GUI_App::is_auto_close_sketch_loops and
# MainFrame::ensure_design_panel, which that tree has never heard of. Syncing all of src/ to fix
# that needs a deps rebuild measured in hours. behemoth already builds this exact tree, already
# runs a WM on :10, and is the machine the user actually runs the product on — so the loop asserts
# against the shipping artefact rather than a stale twin. Reviving the rig means rebuilding its
# deps image first; until then it cannot adjudicate anything about this code.
#
# SC2029: every ssh command below quotes locally-expanded config (HOST, SRC, DISP) on purpose
# -- the remote tree is not this checkout and has no such config of its own.
# shellcheck disable=SC2029
