"""
Every maintenance job for the OrcaSlicer system profile tree, in one tool.

usage: python scripts/orca_profile_tool.py <command> [options]

commands:
  check            validate the whole tree -- what CI runs
  fix-variant      resize the variant arrays check rejects
  generate-id      write the filament_id / setting_id each profile's identity implies
  normalize        rewrite profile files into their canonical shape
  trim             delete profile files no <vendor>.json list references
  update-index     regenerate the *_list sections of <vendor>.json

options shared by several commands:
  --vendor VENDOR      act on one vendor bundle only; repeatable, empty means all
  --profile-type TYPE  one of machine_model/process/filament/machine; repeatable
                       (normalize, trim, update-index)
  --dry-run            report what would change and write nothing (every command
                       that writes)
  --profiles DIR       act on another profile tree (default: resources/profiles)

After adding, renaming or deleting profile files, run:
  normalize -> update-index -> generate-id -> check
normalize supplies missing types; update-index registers presets before id
generation.
Use trim only for deliberate cleanup, previewed with --dry-run: it judges against
the current index and can delete newly added, unindexed presets.

Run from anywhere; "python scripts/orca_profile_tool.py --help" repeats this list
and "... <command> --help" documents one command in full.

The two id rules are the heart of it. Both ids are pure functions of the thing
they name, so nothing here is ever invented: the tool only writes the id the
rules below already imply, and a tree that already satisfies them is left
untouched.

filament_id policy (see docs/HLSD/filament_id.md):
  * filament_id is a PRODUCT id: one named spool product = one id, shared by all
    of that product's per-printer/per-nozzle variants in every bundle. The
    granularity is the name on the spool, not the brand: "AAA PLA Lite" and
    "AAA PLA Pro" are two products with two ids, not variants of one. The
    id is a pure function of the product triple (below), so WHERE a preset gets
    it from is irrelevant: it may declare the key itself or inherit it from any
    ancestor — a root preset, a real (instantiated) filament, an
    OrcaFilamentLibrary (OFL) preset — as long as the id it ends up with is the
    mint of its OWN triple. Inheritance carries settings, never identity; the
    key is bundle-independent, so moving a filament into OFL never changes it.
  * Ids are content-addressed by the product triple, resolved from the preset's
    flattened config (filament_vendor and filament_type are inheritable list
    options — first element; filament name = preset base name):
        filament_id = "OF" + base62_6( uuid5(FILAMENT_ID_NAMESPACE,
            "filament_product/<filament_vendor>/<filament_type>/<filament_name>") )
    8 chars total, which satisfies the AMS length limit. Nobody invents ids by
    hand, and nothing but the triple feeds the mint — not the rest of the tree.
    Two products whose triples mint one id (a base62
    collision; odds ~1e-5 over the whole tree) is an error --check reports and
    --generate refuses to write; the remedy is a rename so the triples differ,
    never a salted or hand-picked second id.
    Identity changes (a filament rename, a filament_vendor/filament_type fix)
    change the id BY DESIGN.
  * EVERY filament profile carries a minted id, with no exceptions and no
    spellings held back for anyone. Ids that other systems compose for their own
    purposes are simply not mints, so no system profile can carry one and there
    is nothing to reserve: Bambu's GF* catalog ids (the generated
    resources/printers/bambu_filament_ids.json records the correspondence, which
    the app applies at the printer boundary), the QD_* ids a Qidi box composes at
    runtime, and the P+7-hex ids CreatePresetsDialog.cpp gives user-created
    filaments all fail the format rule like any other stray value.

setting_id policy (see AGENTS.md "Critical Constraints"):
  * setting_id is a PRESET id, a pure function of the preset's identity:
        setting_id = base62_16( uuid5(NAMESPACE, "<vendor>/<type>/<name>") )
    The same value is recomputed on the fly by the C++ app
    (Slic3r::generate_preset_setting_id); the two MUST stay byte-identical.
    Uniqueness is therefore automatic: two presets collide only if they share
    vendor + type + name, which "check" flags.
  * Only instantiated presets (instantiation == "true") carry a setting_id;
    base / template profiles do not.
  * Bambu (BBL) owns the authoritative "G*" setting_id space and is the only
    reserved vendor: its setting_ids are never rewritten, which keeps
    Bambu-synced presets backward compatible. That exemption is setting_id's
    alone — BBL's filament_ids are minted like every other vendor's.

The effective-id resolution below is loader-faithful (PresetBundle.cpp
load_vendor_configs_from_json): own filament_id key, else walk `inherits` within
the vendor map, with OrcaFilamentLibrary base-bundle fallback; once a chain enters
OFL it stays in OFL; a vendor chain that dead-ends id-less retries its direct
parent in the OFL map. filament_vendor / filament_type resolve the same way.
