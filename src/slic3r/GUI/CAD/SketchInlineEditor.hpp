// Onshape-style in-canvas value editor.
//
// IT IS NOT A WINDOW. It used to be a borderless top-level wxFrame holding a wxTextCtrl, and
// that is the whole history of this file: a separate top-level window can only receive typing
// if the window manager grants it focus, and whether it does is not ours to decide. openbox
// grants it; mutter's focus-stealing prevention refuses it, so on a GNOME desktop the field
// appeared, showed its value selected, and silently ignored every keystroke — Enter then
// committed the number it opened with. Seven workarounds were tried against that (a real X11
// server timestamp for gtk_window_present, re-asserted SetFocus, dropping the _UTILITY hint,
// keeping the frame mapped between two queued fields, forwarding keys from the panel's
// CHAR_HOOK), one of them caused a macOS regression, and the test harness ended up clicking the
// field before typing — which is the workaround a user cannot be asked to perform, and is
// exactly the "label value not editable" report.
//
// So the field stops asking. It is now drawn INSIDE the GL canvas as an ImGui overlay, at the
// same screen point as before, and its keys arrive through the canvas's own key events, which
// GLCanvas3D already feeds to ImGui (see GLCanvas3D::on_key / on_char -> update_key_data). The
// canvas is part of the main window and already has focus, so there is no second window, no
// second focus, and no window manager in the path. The dimension labels next to it are already
// ImGui overlays (DesignSketchTool::draw_dim_label), so this is the same vocabulary, not a new
// one.
//
// Ownership: DesignCanvas owns it; DesignSketchTool::render() calls render() once per frame.

    // This canvas repaints ON DEMAND. ImGui decides whether it wants the keyboard at the END of a
    // frame, from the active item, and GLCanvas3D::on_char only calls render() when
    // update_key_data() says ImGui wants it. No frames -> WantTextInput never turns on -> no
