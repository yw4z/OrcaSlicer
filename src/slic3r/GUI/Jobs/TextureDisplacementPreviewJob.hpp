// layers this is real, non-trivial CPU work (PNG sampling, per-layer vertex welding), which used
// to run synchronously on every paint stroke and parameter tweak and made editing feel slow with
// more than one or two layers. Unlike Bake, this never touches the live Model - a preview is
// purely informational, there is nothing to commit.
//
// Deliberately reports no status: the Job framework turns the first update_status() call into an
// on-screen progress notification, and a preview firing one on every stroke and slider release
// buried the user in notifications that only closed at 100%.

    // current generation when the job completes, so that a burst of edits queuing several of
    // these jobs in a row can't have an earlier, now-stale result clobber a later one that
    // finishes first.
    //
    // `current_generation` is the caller's live counter, shared with the worker thread. The job
    // polls it *while computing* and aborts as soon as it no longer matches - so a preview that has
    // already been superseded stops burning CPU instead of running to completion for a result that
    // will only be thrown away. That matters because the UI job worker runs one job at a time in FIFO
    // order: without it, a Bake queued behind a handful of stale previews waits for every one of them.
