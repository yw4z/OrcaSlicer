// Standalone 2D viewer/editor for a flattened (UV-unwrapped) mesh patch - shows the result of
// GLGizmoTextureDisplacement's LSCM projection method as its own resizable pane (see Plater's
// "uv_editor" AUI pane) rather than folding 2D UV-space rendering into the main 3D viewport.
//
// Islands can be laid out by hand, roughly the way Blender's UV editor works: click one to select
// it, drag to move it, right-drag or press R to rotate it, S to scale it, both about its own centre.
// Islands are free to overlap - nothing re-packs them behind the user's back. The texture underneath
// is always drawn upright and axis-aligned, and it is the islands that move over it, which is what
// makes "rotate this island" a meaningful gesture rather than just spinning the whole texture.
//
// **Geometry is uploaded in the unwrap's own (raw, mm) coordinates, once**, and each island is drawn
// through its own affine matrix passed as a shader uniform. That matters: a patch can easily run to
// a million triangles, and the earlier design - which pre-transformed every UV on the CPU and
// re-uploaded the whole wireframe on every mouse-move event - made a drag cost a couple of hundred
// milliseconds per frame. Moving an island now touches a 2x3 matrix and nothing else.
//
// Uses the app's single shared wxGLContext (via wxGetApp().init_glcontext(), the same call
// View3D/Preview/AssembleView each make in GUI_Preview.cpp) rather than an independent context of
// its own, specifically so it can reuse the app's already-registered "flat"/"flat_texture"
// shaders and GLModel as-is - GLModel::render() looks up its shader via a GUI_App-wide "current
// shader", which only means anything for canvases sharing the app's one real GL context.
