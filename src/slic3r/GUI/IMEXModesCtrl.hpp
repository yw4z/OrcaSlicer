// IMEXModesCtrl — visual parallel-mode editor for the IDEX/IQEX printer tab
//
// A tool tile holds an `std::optional<ImexRole>`: the role the mode gives that tool, or
// nullopt for Inactive (gray — the tool does not take part in this mode). Inactive is the
// editor's own state and the only reason the tile is not a bare ImexRole; it is the absence
// of a role, so it is spelled as one rather than as an extra enumerator that libslic3r would
// then have to keep rejecting. Roles themselves are never re-encoded here — no int state
// table, no second copy of the on-disk letters.
//
//   nullopt          (gray)   — not participating in this mode
//   ImexRole::Primary (green) — the tool the slicer generates paths for
//   ImexRole::Copy    (blue)  — firmware duplicates Primary at an offset
//   ImexRole::Mirror  (amber) — firmware mirrors Primary about an axis
//   ImexRole::Span    (yellow)— multicolor partner of Primary on the same gantry;
//                               declares paired-gantry multicolor topology and
//                               unlocks the multicolor block at slice time. Only
//                               offered on tools sharing primary's gantry, and
//                               only on multi-gantry printers (n_rows >= 2).
//
// Color and legend text are the editor's business and live in role_style(); the tile cycle
// order and the serialized letters come from kImexRoleTable in IMEXHelpers.hpp, so the
// editor cannot drift from the slicer's reading of a mode string.
//
// Active-tools string format: "idx:P,idx:C,idx:M,idx:S"  (backwards-compat: plain "idx" = Primary)
