// Where every IMEX bed zone, carriage collision strip and advisory margin band sits, in
// plate-local millimetres. Purely geometric: no rendering, no clipping against the bed
// outline, no GUI types. PartPlate turns the rectangles into GLModels (clipping each one
// to the bed polygon as it goes) and copies the boxes straight into the members that
// check_outside() consults, so this struct is the whole answer to "which boxes".
//
// Every list is empty and `primary_zone_box` unset when no parallel mode is in effect —
// IMEX off, Primary mode, a 1x1 tool grid, a mode whose tool roster is empty, or a mode
// whose Primary tool is not on the current grid (no `:P` marker, or a `:P` index left
// over from a wider grid). The whole layout hangs off the primary's cell, so without one
// there is nothing to divide and consumers must see the same "no zones" answer.

    // active, Primary included. A Span tool has no entry: it shares the primary's zone
    // rather than owning one. Ghost placement offsets by center[head] - center[primary].
    //
    // EXCEPTION, read before using the X component. These centers are built from the head's
    // OWN grid cell, but an AGGREGATED representative's zone rectangle is pinned to the
    // primary's column and then expanded to a full-width row strip. So for an aggregated head
    // whose own column differs from the primary's, center[head].x names a column its painted
    // zone does not have, and `center[head] - center[primary]` carries a bogus X offset.
    // Reachable at imex_tools_per_gantry >= 3 when the primary-column tool on the aggregated
    // gantry is inactive (e.g. tpg=3, gantry_count=2, mode "0:P,1:S,4:M,5:M").
    // Both current consumers pin X to the primary's center for aggregated heads --
    // PartPlate::calc_imex_ghosts() via bed_x_center, GCodeViewer via sec_center_of() -- and a

// `bed_extents`   — XY extents of the plate shape, in plate-local mm. Zones subdivide it.
//
// Zone sizing keys off the count of ACTIVE tools per axis rather than the grid dimensions,
