// (in mm) that all the layers covering it fold into, in slot order, via their TextureBlendMode.
// The vertex is then moved once, along its base-mesh normal, by that accumulated total.
//
// This replaced an earlier design that instead applied the layers *sequentially*, re-meshing after
// each one and carrying the next layer's paint mask onto the result with
// TriangleSelector::remap_painting(). That was the cause of a real "the second texture is never
// applied" bug: remapping a mask onto a mesh whose vertices had just been displaced out from under
// it routinely produced an empty bitstream, and the layer was then silently skipped. It is also
// what forced the per-layer vertex duplication and the final its_compactify_vertices() pass. The
// accumulate-then-displace formulation has neither problem, is substantially faster (no remap, no
// welding, one pass over the mesh), and - because the output keeps the input's exact vertex
// indexing - lets the GUI overlay a preview on the base mesh without any index translation.
//
// A vertex used by even one *unpainted* triangle of a layer's mask sits on that layer's boundary.
// Whether it moves is TextureDisplacementOptions::displace_border; see that field for why displacing
// it is safe (and the default). Either way the *direction* every vertex moves in is the area-weighted
// normal of the triangles that are painted in at least one layer - not of the whole mesh - so a
// border vertex travels along the painted surface's own normal instead of a blend with whatever
// unpainted geometry meets it there. Without that, the rim of a fully painted face would displace
// along the 45 degrees bisector it shares with the side wall and flare outwards. Interior vertices

// - so a small painted patch on a large model does not quadruple the whole model's triangle count.
// It is nonetheless *conformal*: it never leaves a T-junction/crack at the boundary between the
// refined and coarse regions (the trap that made subdivide_mesh_uniform() deliberately whole-mesh).
//
// A triangle wants refining while it is over at least one of these, whichever applies:
//   - length:  its longest edge exceeds `target_edge_length_mm` (a *baseline* - it applies in feature
//              mode too, and is what stops a coarse triangle from being declared flat merely because
//              the four points the chord test samples happened to land at similar heights on a
//              high-frequency texture: the classic aliasing stall);
//   - feature: (only when `sampler` is set and `chord_tolerance_mm > 0`) the *displaced* surface
//              departs from the flat triangle by more than `chord_tolerance_mm`, measured as the max
//              over the three edge midpoints AND the centroid of |sampled displacement - the flat
//              triangle's barycentric interpolation|. Sampling the interior, not just edge midpoints,
//              is what catches a bump that sits inside a triangle. This is a *curvature* test: it is
//              exactly zero on a plane or a linear ramp (barycentric interpolation is exact there, so
//              those stay coarse - the case a gradient criterion would over-refine) and large on a
//              bump/ridge/noise.
// `min_edge_length_mm` is a hard floor under both: no triangle whose longest edge is already at or
// below it is ever refined, which is also what guarantees termination across a sharp texture step
// (where the chord error never falls below the tolerance no matter how fine the mesh gets).
//
// Refinement runs to completion, not for a fixed number of passes: triangles are taken worst-first
// from a max-heap keyed by how many times over its criteria each one is, so a run that hits the
// `max_triangles` budget has spent it on the largest errors rather than wherever a sweep happened to
// reach. The budget is the only bound on a pathological height field; stopping on it leaves a
// perfectly valid, still-conformal mesh.
//
// How it stays crack-free: only "terminal" edges are ever bisected - an edge that is the longest edge
// of *both* triangles sharing it (or a boundary edge that is the longest of its one triangle).
// Bisecting such an edge splits both its triangles 1->2 around the same new midpoint, so a hanging
// node is never created. The edge to split for a triangle that wants refining is found by Rivara
// longest-edge propagation (LEPP): walk to the longest edge of ever-longer-edged neighbours until a
// terminal edge is reached, and bisect that. Edge length strictly increases along the path (ties
// broken by a mesh-vertex key, which both sides of an edge compute identically), so the walk cannot
// cycle, and Rivara's result is that repeating it refines the original triangle in a bounded number
// of bisections - closing the propagation gap a plain per-edge test leaves behind. The transition
// triangles this pulls in just outside the region are the graded band that makes the size change
// conformal; they are a bounded cost paid once, not a per-pass tax.
//
// If `out_source` is non-null it is resized to the output triangle count and out_source[i] receives
// the input triangle that output triangle i descends from (children inherit their parent's index), so
// a caller can carry per-triangle data - e.g. a paint mask - across the topology change without a
// geometric remap.
