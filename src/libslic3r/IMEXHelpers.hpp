// =============================================================================
// The printer's IMEX mode table
// =============================================================================
// `imex_mode_names`, `imex_mode_active_tools` and `imex_mode_gcodes` are three
// independent ConfigOptionStrings coupled only by POSITION: entry i of each describes
// mode i. Nothing in the config system enforces equal length, and all three are on-disk
// format, so a hand-edited preset, a profile written before a key existed, or a 3MF from
// another build can arrive with a sibling array shorter than `imex_mode_names`.
//
// ImexMode is the in-memory view of one row. It is NOT a config type — nothing
// serializes it, and the three keys keep their names, their types and their on-disk
// representation exactly as before.
//
// Resolution rule. Applied by find_imex_mode() / imex_mode_table() and NOWHERE else;
// every consumer in the tree goes through one of the two:
//   * `imex_mode_names` is the roster. A mode exists iff a row of that array carries its
//     name, and the FIRST such row wins. (The modes editor makes a name unique when it is
//     committed, so duplicates reach here from a hand-edited profile; first-match is what a
//     std::find over the names array already did, and what the editor's own row order
//     means.)
//   * A sibling array too short to reach that row yields an EMPTY string for that field
//     and sets `ragged`. It never yields an out-of-range read, and it never degrades to
//     "no such mode": a missing script is a mode with no script, and the row's index
//     still has to be reported to {imex_mode_index}. Callers that need tools already
//     treat an empty tools string as "no tools" (imex_primary_tool_for_mode() returns -1,
//     parse_imex_active_tools() returns {}), which is the behavior they had before.
//   * `ragged` separates "the profile omitted this row" from "the author wrote an empty
//     entry" — a distinction every open-coded call site used to lose.
//
// Reporting: a non-Primary mode that resolves to an empty tool roster produces G-code
// that is wrong rather than merely unconfigured (no per-head temperature transition, and
// a suppressed initial T<n>), so GCode::_do_export() warns and falls back to Primary,
// exactly as it already does for a name that resolves to no row at all.

// =============================================================================
// PHYSICAL vs LOGICAL extruder indices — read this before adding a new IMEX call site
// =============================================================================
// IMEX has two distinct index spaces and they are NOT interchangeable on MMU/AFC
// printers (where multiple logical filament slots share one physical extruder):
//
//   * PHYSICAL extruder index — identifies a hardware carriage / hotend.
//     Source: `imex_mode_active_tools` ("0:P,1:C,2:M") and `printer_extruder_id`.
//     Use for: user-facing labels (shown as "T0", "T1"...), per-firmware tool
//     qualifiers (Klipper EXTRUDER=extruderN, RRF M572 D<N>, Marlin T<N>), and
//     anything that addresses hardware.
//
//   * LOGICAL filament slot index — identifies one filament in the project.
//     Source: indexing into per-filament arrays — `filament_presets`,
//     `nozzle_temperature_initial_layer`, bed_temp arrays per plate type, etc.
//     Use for: looking up filament data by slot.
//
// On a single-extruder or pure-IDEX printer the two indices coincide. On any
// printer with `physical_extruder_map` size > 1 they diverge. Confusing them
// produces silent wrong-filament behavior — the slicer reads the wrong filament
// preset / temperature for a given carriage with no error or log line.
//
// Translate physical → logical via:
//     resolve_filament_for_head(plate_head_filament_map, pem, physical_idx)
// (or the simpler `first_filament_for_physical_head` if no per-plate override).
//
// The reverse translation (logical → physical) is `imex_pem_tool_for`. Do NOT reach for
// `pem.get_at(logical_idx)`: get_at() CLAMPS an out-of-range index to values.front(), silently
// answering "physical head pem[0]" for a logical id that has no mapping at all. The map is one
// entry per nozzle while logical ids index filament slots, and nothing caps the slot count at
// the nozzle count, so out-of-range is reachable. Bounds-check and treat the miss as "no
// mapping" (-1).
//
// The same nozzle-vs-slot divergence bites in the other direction: anything derived from pem
// -- `resolve_filament_for_head`, `first_filament_for_physical_head` -- answers in NOZZLE index
// space, so bound it against the FILAMENT SLOT COUNT before using it as a filament id. Not
// against the option you are about to read: a variant-expanded option such as
// nozzle_temperature is as long as its columns, and is_extruder_used is padded to
// MAXIMUM_EXTRUDER_NUMBER, so both admit slots the project does not have.
//
// A miss is -1, and -1 is a correct tool QUALIFIER but not a skip-the-primary sentinel: no
// physical head equals it, so a test written as `head == primary` stops skipping anything. Do
// not substitute the mode's declared primary there. Which head prints a filament is answered by
// the filament and pem, never by a mode role: a primary-mode print may use any or all tools, one
// at a time, and pem is what says which. When pem cannot answer, the head is genuinely unknown -
// an omitted qualifier then applies to the active tool, which is the head printing that filament,
// so the honest options are to leave it unqualified or to emit nothing, not to name a carriage.
// Known gap, unreported: the two skip sites in GCode.cpp therefore skip nothing for a filament
// slot past the end of pem, so a plate with more slots than nozzles double-writes the primary's
// pressure advance and hands it another filament's transition temperature.
//
// -1 as a tool qualifier reaches GCodeWriter::set_pressure_advance, which omits the qualifier
// on Klipper, Marlin and BBL but substitutes the historical `D0` on RepRapFirmware
// (GCodeWriter.cpp, set_pressure_advance) -- deliberate, not a miss.
//
// Past bugs in this class:
//   - GCode PA emission used the inline `pem.get_at(filament_id)` form at two
//     sites (consolidated into `imex_pem_tool_for` in c2492ccc47).
//   - Pre-slice warnings indexed `filament_presets` directly by physical idx,
//     causing wrong-filament names on AFC/MMU layouts (fixed in fbc58d2a1d).
//   - Ghost color resolution had its own inline pem lookup with a stale default
//     (centralized in `effective_physical_extruder_map` in 6a3de6a28f).
//
// New call sites: if you index a per-filament array, you need a logical index.
// If you label a hardware carriage, use the physical index. When in doubt,
// route through one of the helpers below.
// =============================================================================

// physical_extruder_map has one entry per LOGICAL extruder -- the index space of
// nozzle_diameter -- with each value a physical extruder index. It is NOT derivable from
// printer_extruder_id, which is indexed by variant slot (one entry per extruder+variant pair):
// an X1 Carbon has one nozzle and printer_extruder_id {1,1}, an H2D two nozzles and {1,1,2,2,2}.
//
// A profile has authored a map only when its length matches nozzle_count; otherwise the identity
// is returned, which is the same default upstream applies (see Plater.cpp's extruder_map).

//
// Gated on is_imex because physical_extruder_map carries two readings in this tree: the

// ungated mapping would impose the IMEX reading on profiles that mean the other one --
// fdm_bbl_3dp_002_common ships a non-identity [1,0] and is spared today only because
// single_extruder_multi_material suppresses the T qualifier entirely.
//
// Out-of-range ids pass through unchanged, the same rule GCodeProcessor's preheat rewrite
// uses (GCode/GCodeProcessor.cpp:1407), so a printer whose map is the registered
// single-entry default is unaffected.

// (Klipper SET_PRINT_MODE / RRF M567 — both reference an active tool by definition),
// so any slicer-emitted T<n> at print-start is a duplicate.
//
// Mid-print toolchanges in parallel mode are intentionally NOT suppressed:

//
// Multi-color in a parallel mode requires the firmware to swap tools mid-print on the
// primary gantry while the slaved gantry follows automatically. That works only when
// every used filament has its own dedicated physical head (no MMU lane sharing), the

// declares "this tool is the within-gantry multicolor partner of Primary"; it
// disambiguates the multicolor topology from independent same-gantry copies), AND every
// used filament routes to the primary or one of its Span tools, the only heads that print
// colors of their own.
//
// Catches:
//   - IDEX (1 tool per gantry): primary's gantry can never carry a Span partner → blocked
//   - IQEX 2-tool-active (e.g. T0 primary + T2 copy on different gantries): no Span on
//     primary's gantry → blocked
//   - MMU/AFC sharing among used filaments: multiple used filaments routed to same
//     physical head → blocked (the slaved gantry can't follow MMU lane swaps)
//   - IQEX 4-tool independent copies (T0:P,T1:C,T2:M,T3:M): no Span declared, T1 is an
//     independent copy → blocked
//   - IQEX paired-gantry multicolor (T0:P,T1:S,T2:M,T3:M): Span on T1 declares the
//     multicolor partner, no MMU sharing → ALLOWED for colors on T0 and T1; a color
//     routed to T2, T3 or past the end of the map → blocked
