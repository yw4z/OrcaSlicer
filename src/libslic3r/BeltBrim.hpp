// Belt-printer brim geometry.
//
// A belt printer slices in a ROTATED frame, so the belt surface is not the
// Z=0 bed plane but a tilted plane in slicing space:
//
//     z_slicing(u) = shear * u + floor_offset + z_shift,   u = X or Y
//
// where `shear == tan(tilt)` (SlicingParameters::belt_floor_shear_factor) and
// the axis is selected by SlicingParameters::belt_floor_from_axis.  See
// Support/BeltFloorContext.hpp for the canonical accessors.
//
// Consequences that drive everything in this file:
//
//   * A horizontal slicing layer touches the belt only along a narrow strip at
//     its leading edge, `layer_height / shear` wide (~0.2 mm at 45 degrees).
//     The object's belt footprint - its bottom face - is therefore spread over
//     every layer, not contained in layer 0.
//   * Distances measured in slicing XY are NOT on-belt distances: moving `du`
//     along the shear axis travels `du / cos(tilt)` across the belt.  So brim
//     offsets have to be taken in a "flattened" space where the shear axis is
//     stretched by `1 / cos(tilt)`, then mapped back.
//   * Brim ahead of the part (downhill) lies at slicing Z BELOW the object's
//     first layer, because the object's layer 0 is precisely its leading
//     contact with the belt.
//
// Everything here is pure geometry on ExPolygons/Polylines so it can be unit
// tested without a Print.  Keep user-visible strings out of this file: it is
// not listed in localization/i18n/list.txt.
