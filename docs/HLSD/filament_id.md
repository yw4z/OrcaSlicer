# Filament IDs (`filament_id`)

`filament_id` identifies one **filament product**: one named spool product = one id, shared by
all of that product's per-printer / per-nozzle variants, in every profile bundle that ships it.
Devices use it to match a physical spool or tray to a filament preset. It is never per-color,
per-printer, per-nozzle, or per-preset (per-preset identity is `setting_id`), and it is never
per-bundle either — PolyLite PLA carries the same id whether the preset lives in the
OrcaFilamentLibrary (OFL), Qidi, or Snapmaker bundle. The granularity is the name on the spool,
not the brand behind it: `AAA PLA Lite` and `AAA PLA Pro` are two filaments with two ids, not
variants of one.

**How it is generated:** an id is computed, never invented. `scripts/orca_id_tool.py`
mints it as a deterministic hash of the product's identity — the triple
`(filament_vendor, filament_type, filament name)`, where the filament name is the preset name
with its `@...` variant suffix stripped — producing an 8-character `OF*` code that is the
same for that product in every bundle, in every PR, on every machine. For example, Polymaker's
PolyLite PLA presets (`PolyLite PLA @base`, `PolyLite PLA@Q2-Series`, …) resolve
`filament_vendor` `Polymaker`, `filament_type` `PLA`, and filament name `PolyLite PLA`; hashing
`filament_product/Polymaker/PLA/PolyLite PLA` yields `OF5CgdDq`, and that is the id the
OrcaFilamentLibrary, OrcaArena, Qidi, and Snapmaker bundles all arrive at independently
(derivation details in the Minting section).

**How it is used:** at runtime the id is the join key between hardware and profiles.
When a printer reports what a tray holds (Bambu AMS, Qidi box, Creality CFS,
Klipper, Snapmaker), OrcaSlicer matches the reported id against the filament presets
compatible with that printer to select the right profile; other features — tray display
names, support-material detection, vitrification warnings, multi-nozzle filament grouping —
look up material properties by id alone. An id that changes is not forwarded anywhere: a
tray or record still holding the old value falls back to matching by material type until the
user re-selects the filament, so identity changes are made deliberately and rarely.

This page is the rule for authoring `filament_id` in system profiles
(`resources/profiles/**`). CI enforces everything below; the short version is:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Never write a `filament_id` value by hand.** A new filament gets its id from
> `python scripts/orca_id_tool.py --generate`; one already in the tree has one — inherit it.

## The design, in two pieces

Because several consumers match **globally by id alone, first hit wins** (see the next
section), any two materials sharing one id feed wrong data somewhere — a wrong tray name, a
wrong support-material flag, a wrong nozzle grouping — and inside one printer a duplicated id
makes AMS spool matching a coin toss. Hand-written ids produce such collisions constantly, so
the system is built to make them impossible:

1. **Deterministic minting.** An id is a pure hash of the product's identity — no registry to
   maintain, no next-free-number ceremony, no way for two concurrent PRs to race for the same
   number, and no way to get it wrong by hand, because you never write it by hand.
2. **A sanctioned snapshot.** The complete id landscape derived from the tree must equal
   `scripts/filament_id_snapshot.json` exactly, so every change to ids, claims (which bundles
   ship which id, and for which filament), or product identity surfaces as a reviewable diff to
   one file — the maintainer gate.

## Who consumes the id

The canonical consumer is tray-to-preset matching: a device reports a tray material id
(`tray_info_idx`), and the shared matching pipeline (`PresetBundle::sync_ams_list` and
friends) resolves it to a preset. The matcher is printer-scoped and first-match-wins:
scanning only compatible root presets — system roots plus user-made custom filaments, which
are user roots carrying their own `P*` ids; a preset derived from another resolves through
its root and never matches directly — it picks the first one whose `filament_id` equals the
tray's. On a miss it falls back by filament type: a system `Generic <type>` preset
(matched by name, then by type similarity), else the slot's previous selection, else any compatible system generic or,
failing that, any compatible system preset, else the slot is skipped — every fallback
selection surfaces a user-visible notice.

Today only the Bambu AMS integration follows this pattern end to end — the device itself
reports the id, `BBLPrinterAgent` translates it out of Bambu's catalog into ours, and the
pipeline does all the matching. The other device integrations still synthesize a preset id
client-side in their agents (by type, brand, or color lookups against the loaded presets)
before the pipeline runs; they are intended to converge on the same pattern, with the
device-reported tray material id flowing through the shared matcher.

| Ecosystem | Where the tray id comes from today |
| --- | --- |
| Bambu AMS | the device itself (RFID / user tray setting), in Bambu's own `GF*` catalog; `BBLPrinterAgent` rewrites it into our id before the matcher sees it (see [The Bambu catalog map](#the-bambu-catalog-map)) |
| Qidi box | composed at runtime as `QD_<series>_<vendor>_<typeidx>` — vendor and type indices from the device's per-slot saved variables, the series digit inferred client-side from the printer model/name. No preset carries a `QD_*` value, so the slot currently resolves by filament type; mapping the composed id onto the filament's minted id belongs in the agent |
| Creality CFS | runtime brand/type scoring returns the winning preset's id |
| Klipper (AFC / Happy Hare) | runtime lookup by filament type |
| Snapmaker | runtime color/vendor/type match |

Tray-to-preset matching is printer-scoped, but **several consumers match globally by id alone,
first hit wins**: tray display names, `filament_is_support`, vitrification warnings, and
multi-nozzle filament grouping in the slicing pipeline (`FilamentGroup::try_merge_filaments`
merges plate slots sharing one `(filament_id, color)` pair, with matching
extruder-printability, onto one nozzle group; the engine is implemented but no grouping path
calls it yet).
Two *different* materials sharing one id
feed wrong data to those consumers even when the presets live in different vendors — so
cross-material id sharing is never safe. Within one printer, duplicate ids break AMS matching:
the matcher picks whichever preset loads first (it now logs an "Ambiguous AMS filament match"
warning, but the pick is still arbitrary) and the tray-edit dialog, which lists one entry per
id, hides the second preset entirely. The profile validator's `-f` check
(`check_filament_subtypes` → `PresetBundle::check_duplicate_filament_subtypes`) rejects this
per printer, and CI runs it tree-wide.

Two more consumer-side facts worth knowing:

- The machine-facing dialogs (AMS tray edit, AMS dry control, calibration history, extrusion
  calibration) offer the filaments a connected printer can use by the same compatibility rule
  the plater uses (an empty `compatible_printers` means *every* printer). Alias shadowing
  still applies: a vendor's same-name profile supersedes the library generic. That is what
  puts Orca Filament Library materials in those lists — deduplicated to one entry per
  `filament_id` in the AMS and calibration-history dialogs, while extrusion calibration
  deliberately lists every matching preset by full name.
- The id is load-bearing at startup: an instantiated system filament (one marked
  `"instantiation": "true"` — see the structure rules) that resolves **no**
  `filament_id` anywhere in its `inherits` chain is a hard load error in the C++ loader
  (`Can not find filament_id for <name>`) that discards the entire vendor bundle (for the
  OrcaFilamentLibrary itself the failure is messier: library presets loaded before the
  failing one survive, and every vendor bundle whose filaments inherit from the library is
  then discarded for want of a base). CI's structure check catches this before it ships.

## Do I need a new id? The one-question test

> **Would a user consider this a different spool product than anything already in the tree?**

Different polymer, different sub-brand (Basic / Matte / Silk / HF), fiber-filled sibling, or a
second selectable diameter → **new filament, new id**. The same spool tuned for another printer
or nozzle → **join the existing filament** (keep its base name and inherit it; no id
key needed). Tuning a generic material → **join the OrcaFilamentLibrary filament** (inherit
`Generic X @System` and keep the `Generic X` base name; no id key needed).

| Situation | id |
| --- | --- |
| Per-printer / per-nozzle variant of an existing material | same id (inherit it) |
| Sub-brand or product line (PLA vs PLA Matte vs PLA Silk vs PLA HF) | new id each |
| Color | never a new id |
| Second diameter of the same product (1.75 + 2.85) | sibling filament, new id |
| "High-speed" tuned for a *different printer model* | same id (it is a printer variant) |
| "High-speed" selectable *alongside* the normal preset on one printer | new name, so a new id (it is a product line) |

## Structure rules

1. **Every preset carries the id of its own product, wherever it gets it from.** The id is a
   function of the preset's own triple (rule 5), and `inherits` carries settings, never
   identity. So a preset may declare the key itself or inherit it from any ancestor — a
   `<Filament> @base` root, a real (instantiated) preset of the same filament, an
   OrcaFilamentLibrary preset — and CI checks one thing: the id it ends up with equals the
   mint of *its* triple. The usual shape is one `@base` root (`"instantiation": "false"`)
   declaring the key and the per-printer variants inheriting it; a filament may have several
   roots — Qidi's PolyLite PLA has four per-series roots (`PolyLite PLA@Q2-Series`,
   `@Q2C-Series`, `@X-Max 4-Series`, `@X-Plus 5-Series`) — which then all declare the identical
   id. A branded filament that borrows a generic's settings (`Flashforge ABS Basic @FF C5`
   inherits `Generic ABS @System`) declares its own id, because its triple is its own.
2. **The filament name is the base name**: the preset name with everything from the first
   (optionally space-preceded) `@` stripped. `MyBrand PLA @Orca 3D Fuse1` and `MyBrand PLA@HS`
   are both the filament `MyBrand PLA`.
3. **Within one filament, variants' `compatible_printers` are pairwise disjoint** — per printer,
   at most one compatible instantiated preset per id, or AMS matching turns ambiguous. The
   C++ validator's `-f` check enforces this, tree-wide in CI. Since one product carries one id
   and cannot be split onto two, this rule is the *only* remedy for such an ambiguity: narrow
   the `compatible_printers`, or retire the preset that duplicates another.
4. **Generics belong to OrcaFilamentLibrary.** A vendor tuning a generic material inherits
   `Generic X @System`, keeps the `Generic X` base name (that alias is what hides the library
   preset on your printers, and it is what makes its triple — and so its id — the library's)
   and sets a non-empty `compatible_printers` — e.g. `Generic PLA @Sovol SV08 MAX` inherits
   `Generic PLA @System` and lists three Sovol nozzles. Renaming such a preset makes it a
   different product by rule 5, so it then needs its own id.
5. **Ids follow the product identity.** The id is a pure function of the product triple
   `(filament_vendor, filament_type, filament name)`, so correcting any of them re-mints the id
   **by design**, applied by `--generate` (preview with `--dry-run`, confine with `--vendor`) and
   gated by the `--update-snapshot` diff; the exact sequence is in the FAQ. Nothing forwards
   the old value, so anything outside the tree that stored it — a device tray, a calibration
   record, a saved project — falls back to matching by filament type until the user re-selects
   the filament. Re-mint deliberately, and only to fix a genuinely wrong identity.
   (`renamed_from` still gates preset-*name* compatibility, as before.)

## Minting — nobody invents ids

New ids are deterministic, computed exactly like the `setting_id` precedent
(the `setting_id` half of `scripts/orca_id_tool.py`):

```text
FILAMENT_ID_NAMESPACE = uuid5(setting-id NAMESPACE, "filament_id")
                      = c4d3ff49-4c32-5534-a3e3-00894157ab97
filament_id = "OF" + base62_6( uuid5(FILAMENT_ID_NAMESPACE,
                  "filament_product/<filament_vendor>/<filament_type>/<filament_name>") )
```

`base62_6` is the low 6 base62 digits (alphabet `0-9A-Za-z`) of the UUID taken as a big-endian
integer, most-significant digit first; with the `OF` prefix the full id is 8 chars, within the
AMS length limit. The triple comes from the root preset's *flattened* config:
`<filament_vendor>` is the filament
**manufacturer** (`"Polymaker"`, or `"Generic"` for generics — never the printer brand),
`<filament_type>` the material type, `<filament_name>` the root's base name; the two config
values are inheritable list options and the first element counts.

Content-addressing on that triple is what makes the whole system converge. The key contains no
bundle name, so the same product mints the same id in every bundle — moving a filament into
OrcaFilamentLibrary never changes its id, and two vendors independently shipping the same
product arrive at the same id without coordinating. `Polymaker/PLA/PolyLite PLA` mints
`OF5CgdDq`, and that one id is declared by the OrcaFilamentLibrary, OrcaArena, Qidi, and
Snapmaker bundles alike; the OFL generic `Generic/PLA/Generic PLA` mints `OFDSrzZ8`, claimed
by 35 bundles — most by independent declarations converging on the same mint, the rest
purely through inheritance from the OFL preset.

Nothing but the triple feeds the mint — not the rest of the tree, not the snapshot, not what
another preset of the product happens to carry. Determined triple, determined id: one product
carries one id and there is no second acceptable value for it, so any other value on a preset
is a mismatch `--check` reports and `--generate` pulls back. Two *different* products whose
triples mint the same base62 value would be a collision (a roughly 36-bit id space against a
few thousand products); nothing salts past it: `--check` reports it naming both products,
`--generate` refuses to write it, and the remedy is a rename so their triples differ. Where
two presets of one product would be AMS-ambiguous on a printer, the fix is likewise in the
profiles — make their `compatible_printers` disjoint (structure rule 3), retire the redundant
preset, or, if they really are different products, give them different names so their triples
differ. Never a second id for one triple.

Workflow for a new filament:

```bash
# 1. Author the filament with NO filament_id key anywhere.
python scripts/orca_id_tool.py --dry-run          # 2. preview the ids — writes nothing
python scripts/orca_id_tool.py --generate         # 3. apply them to the profile file(s)
python scripts/orca_id_tool.py --update-snapshot  # 4. record the new claims in the snapshot
python scripts/orca_id_tool.py --check            # 5. validate the filament_id state
python scripts/orca_extra_profile_check.py        # 6. ...and everything else CI checks
# 7. Commit the profile edits together with scripts/filament_id_snapshot.json, for review.
```

`--generate` makes every filament's id equal the mint of its own
`(filament_vendor, filament_type, filament name)` triple: it inserts one where an instantiated
filament resolves none, and re-derives one that does not match. A preset that *inherits* a
mismatching id is the one case left to the author — check 3b names it, and the fix is to inherit
a preset of the same filament or to give the preset its own key. A declaration is left alone
exactly when it already equals the one id its triple mints, and a collision (check 3d) is
reported and left unwritten. The same run assigns
`generate_preset_setting_id(vendor, type, name)` to every instantiated filament, process
and machine preset of every vendor except BBL, which keeps its authoritative `G*` ids, strips
`setting_id` from base profiles, and fixes the misspelled `settings_id` key — dropped, or, for
BBL, whose ids have no formula to fall back on, restored under the correct name. It is idempotent and
byte-preserving (indentation, BOM, and line endings intact, every edited file re-parsed to fail
loudly), and a no-op on a tree that already passes `scripts/orca_extra_profile_check.py` — the
check CI runs over both id kinds, of which `--check` is the `filament_id` half.

- `--filament-id` limits the run to `filament_id`.
- `--setting-id` limits the run to `setting_id`. The two exclude each other; pass neither to
  write both.
- `--vendor VENDOR` confines the run to that bundle; repeatable. The id is a function of the
  triple alone, so a narrowed run writes exactly what a full one would; `--check` reports
  whatever it left outside.
- `--dry-run` reports what `--generate` would do and writes nothing; with no mode of its own it
  implies `--generate`, so `--dry-run --vendor <Vendor>` previews just that bundle.
- `--profiles DIR` points the tooling at a different profile tree (default
  `resources/profiles`). `--check` and `--update-snapshot` read and write the sanctioned state of
  the tree they are given, so pointing them elsewhere needs `--snapshot PATH` for that tree too —
  `scripts/filament_id_snapshot.json` describes `resources/profiles` and no other tree.

**Identity fixes need no separate mode.** `--generate` re-derives an id that no longer matches its
triple exactly the way it fills in a missing one, so a rename or a `filament_vendor` /
`filament_type` correction is just: fix the config, run `--generate` (confine it with `--vendor`,
preview it with `--dry-run`), then `--update-snapshot` and review the diff.

If you skip the tooling, CI fails and prints the remedy: the expected id for your filament and
the instruction to run `python scripts/orca_id_tool.py --generate`; once the id is minted, the
snapshot checks likewise point at `--update-snapshot` and tell you to commit the resulting
diff.

## Reserved namespaces — never mint or hand-write into

A **reserved namespace** is an id space no system profile may declare, because an external
catalog or a device protocol owns the values. None of them has an owning vendor: there is no
bundle — not even the one whose printers use the catalog — that may write one into a profile.

| Space | Status | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GF*` | Bambu AMS/RFID catalog | declarable by **nobody**, BBL included: Bambu's own ids live in the generated catalog map, never in a profile |
| `QD_*` | Qidi device protocol | declarable by **nobody**, Qidi included: the box composes these ids at runtime and they are not preset ids |
| `P` + 7 hex chars (case-insensitive), `"null"` | user-created custom filaments (`CreatePresetsDialog.cpp`) | never appears in system profiles |

The two device namespaces, in detail:

- **Bambu (`GF*`).** Bambu's device/RFID/cloud catalog is external and opaque, which is a
  reason to keep it out of the profiles rather than to let one bundle own it. Every BBL filament
  mints an `OF` id from its triple like every other vendor's, and the correspondence to Bambu's
  catalog ids lives in one generated file the app applies at the printer boundary — the next
  section. Nothing under `resources/profiles/**` carries a `GF*` id today and nothing can be
  exempted, so a `GF*` id appearing anywhere in the tree is a mistake, whoever wrote it.
- **Qidi (`QD_*`).** `QD_*` is a device-*protocol* namespace, not a preset id space: the
  Qidi box path composes `QD_<series>_<vendor>_<typeidx>` ids at runtime (slot vendor and
  type indices reported by the device, the series digit inferred client-side from the printer
  model/name). Qidi presets carry ordinary minted `OF*` ids (generics share the OFL ids), so
  a composed id matches no preset and the slot falls back to filament type; translating it to
  the filament's id belongs in `QidiPrinterAgent`. The alternative — treating per-series
  protocol ids as preset ids — would put one product under five ids (`QIDI PLA Rapido` would
  be `QD_0_1_1` through `QD_4_1_1`), exactly the fragmentation the mint rule removes.

## The Bambu catalog map

Bambu's printers, its AMS and its cloud know only Bambu's own catalog ids. Our profiles carry
minted `OF` ids like every other vendor's, so one generated file records the correspondence and
the app applies it **only where an id crosses to or from a Bambu printer**.

**The file** is `resources/printers/bambu_filament_ids.json` — a header plus one row per
catalogued product, keyed by our id:

```json
{
  "source": "https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio",
  "bambustudio_commit": "66e405477",
  "generated": "2026-09-04",
  "filaments": {
    "OFhuaUQB": { "bambu_id": "GFB00", "vendor": "Bambu Lab", "type": "ABS", "name": "Bambu ABS" }
  }
}
```

It ships in `resources/printers/`, next to `filaments_blacklist.json` — deliberately not in
`resources/profiles/`, where the loader reads every top-level `.json` as a vendor index. It
holds 100 rows today, one per product BambuStudio ships, and the correspondence is
one-to-one in both directions.

**It is generated, never hand-edited.** `python scripts/update_bambu_filament_ids.py` rebuilds
it from **BambuStudio's own shipped BBL bundle** — a sparse shallow clone of upstream `master`,
or `--bambustudio-dir <a BambuStudio resources/profiles checkout>`. Our BBL bundle is a fork of
Bambu's, tuned and extended independently, so it is not the source of truth for Bambu's ids.
A row's key is the id the product's `(filament_vendor, filament_type, filament name)` triple
mints — the same id any bundle of ours carries for it, since the id is a function of the triple
alone; the row of a product we do not ship sits inert until some bundle claims that triple —
`OFdyfQvU` / `GFG03`, "Bambu PETG Matte", is such a row today.

**Regenerate it in the same commit as every BBL profile sync**, and read the drift report it
prints. Two lines, both informational, neither blocking the write:

```text
upstream ships 'Bambu PETG Matte' (Bambu Lab/PETG), we ship nothing with that identity
Orca BBL filaments with no row: 135 Orca-only product(s)
```

The first names each upstream product our BBL bundle has no same-identity filament for —
sometimes a genuinely missing product, sometimes a name drift a follow-up rename would
converge. The second counts our own BBL filaments that matched no row: 135 of 234 today, of
which 109 send an `OF` id on the wire and 26 already rode `OF` ids inherited from the
OrcaFilamentLibrary. **135 is the number to expect at every regeneration** — 109 was the
one-off size of the transition and stopped being computable from the tree once the BBL bundle
was re-minted, so do not "fix" the report to print it.

**Check 6** lives in `check_filament_ids`, so profile CI runs it alongside the other five. It
holds the file to its contract: it parses, carries `source` / `bambustudio_commit` /
`generated`, keys only `OF`-format ids, maps each Bambu id at most once, and — for every row
whose key the tree actually claims — agrees with the tree on that id's `(vendor, type, name)`
triple. A row for a product we do not ship is skipped, not an error. The remedy it prints is
always the same: regenerate the map and commit the diff for review.

### The runtime rule: swap on hit

Outbound, our id with a row becomes Bambu's; inbound, Bambu's id with a row becomes ours.
Everything else is forwarded untouched — an `OF` id with no row, a Bambu id for a product we do
not ship, a `P`-hex user id, `"null"`, an empty string. Translation is confined to the
boundary: nothing between the boundaries ever holds a Bambu id.

Translating one value is a capability of the printer agent: `IPrinterAgent` declares
`to_orca_filament_id` and `from_orca_filament_id` returning their argument, and `BBLPrinterAgent`
overrides them with Bambu's map, so an agent whose printers already speak our ids inherits the
identity default and translates nothing. `NetworkAgent` forwards both to the live agent, so the
comparison sites below reach them through `wxGetApp().getAgent()` and leave an id untranslated
while no agent is live. Whole documents are Bambu's business alone:
`BBLPrinterAgent::to_orca_payload` and `from_orca_payload` rewrite every string under
`tray_info_idx`, `filament_id` or `filamentId` at any depth; text that does not parse, or carries
none of those keys, comes back unchanged. The map is loaded once, lazily; a missing or malformed
file degrades to identity with a log line rather than failing.

| Boundary | Where it translates |
| --- | --- |
| Everything the agent sends | `BBLPrinterAgent::send_message` and `send_message_to_printer`, plus `PrintParams::ams_mapping_info` in `dispatch_start` — the funnel all five `start_*` calls share |
| Everything the agent receives | `set_on_message_fn` and `set_on_local_message_fn` wrap their callback, so `MachineObject::parse_json` and everything downstream see our ids only |
| 3mf export | `Plater::export_3mf` writes Bambu's ids into `slice_info.config`, gated on `preset_bundle.is_bbl_vendor()` — the printer reads that file and knows only its own catalog, and no other vendor's export is affected. The CLI has its own writer in `OrcaSlicer.cpp`; it does the same, gated on the `printer_model` prefix that already decides `Print::is_BBL_printer()` for that run |
| Project ingest | `Plater::priv::load_files` reverse-maps the project's `filament_ids` before the bundle ingests them, so a project saved by an older Orca or by BambuStudio still resolves the same presets |
| Prints from the printer's SD card | `SelectMachineDialog::update_print_required_data` reverse-maps each plate's slice-info ids as it adopts the plates, so the AMS mapping dialog pairs them with trays |
| Bambu-specific comparisons | `CalibUtils.cpp`, `DeviceManager.cpp`, `DeviceCore/DevFilaSystem.cpp`, `DeviceCore/DevFilaBlackList.cpp`, `SelectMachine.cpp`, `AMSDryControl.cpp`, `AMSMaterialsSetting.cpp`, `PresetComboBoxes.cpp`, `ColorDecomposeSupport.cpp` |

That last row is the rule to follow when a new Bambu-specific behaviour is added: **translate
the value you are about to compare, never the table you compare it against.** The shipped data
those sites read is Bambu's and stays verbatim — `white_fila_ids` in
`resources/printers/filaments_blacklist.json`, the calibration id lists in
`resources/printers/<model>.json`, `fila_id` in
`resources/profiles/BBL/filament/filaments_color_codes.json`.

`tests/slic3rutils/test_bambu_filament_ids.cpp` covers the lookups, the payload rewrite and the
Bambu-specific rules. `orcaslicer_discover_tests` registers a Catch2 tag as a CTest **label**,
not as part of the test name, so `-R` matches nothing here and the filter is `-L`:

```bash
ctest --test-dir <build dir>/tests/slic3rutils -L BambuFilamentIds
```

### Three places the map deliberately does not reach

The map and its lookups live in the GUI library, which libslic3r cannot link against and which a
GUI-less build does not link at all. Three consequences are known and documented; none is worth
pulling the map down into libslic3r for.

- **The support display type in `PrintConfig.cpp`.** `DynamicPrintConfig::get_filament_type`
  picks `PLA-S` / `Sup.PLA` and `PA-S` / `Sup.PA` for a support filament by testing
  `filament_id` against `GFS00` and `GFS01`, and otherwise falls back on `filament_type` — a
  fallback that returns those same two pairs for `"PLA"` and `"PA"`. Bambu Support W inherits
  `fdm_filament_pla` and Bambu Support G inherits `fdm_filament_pa`, so with their `OF` ids the
  fallback produces exactly what the id branches produced. (The only config that ever carries a
  singular `filament_id` key is the AMS tray config built in `Plater.cpp`, and that one never
  reaches this function.) These two lines are the only mention of a Bambu id anywhere in
  libslic3r, and they need no change.
- **Config imports.** `PresetBundle::import_presets` (File ▸ Import ▸ Import Configs, for
  `.json` / `.zip` / `.orca_filament` / `.orca_printer` / `.orca_bundle`) and
  `PresetBundle::load_config_file` (the CLI's `--load-settings` of a G-code file with an
  embedded config) both parse inside libslic3r, out of the GUI's reach, so a Bambu id carried
  in such a file lands on the imported preset untranslated. The effect is bounded: that preset
  does not auto-match an AMS tray while the stale id is live, and the id does not survive
  being saved — `Preset::save` writes a `filament_id` key only for a preset whose `inherits` is
  empty, and on the next load an inheriting preset takes its parent's id. A known gap, and not
  a regression: nothing forwarded a stale id before either.
- **A build configured without the GUI.** `target_link_libraries(OrcaSlicer libslic3r_gui)` sits
  inside `if (SLIC3R_GUI)` in `src/CMakeLists.txt`, so the lookups are not linkable when the GUI
  is off. The CLI's 3mf writer in `src/OrcaSlicer.cpp` therefore guards its translation with
  `#ifdef SLIC3R_GUI`, and a 3mf that such a build slices for a Bambu printer carries our `OF`
  ids in `slice_info.config` rather than Bambu's. Every shipped build enables the GUI, so this
  reaches only a purpose-built GUI-less binary.

One more thing worth recording before it is rediscovered:
`SyncAmsInfoDialog::update_print_required_data` is a structural twin of the SD-card function
above and carries no translation. It has no callers today and its plate list is only ever read
for `printer_model_id`, so it is not a live gap — but wiring it up without adding the reverse
map would silently reproduce the bug.

## How CI enforces this

Profile CI (`check_profiles.yml`) runs `check_filament_ids()` tree-wide via
`scripts/orca_extra_profile_check.py`. Its ground truth is
**`scripts/filament_id_snapshot.json` — the sanctioned state**: the id state derived from the
tree must equal the snapshot exactly, in both directions. Any change to the id landscape
therefore surfaces as a diff to that file, and **that snapshot diff is what maintainers review
and gate in a PR**. Never edit the snapshot by hand — `--update-snapshot` regenerates it
deterministically (running it twice changes nothing). The snapshot holds one map, `ids`: each
entry is the product the id is minted from (`filament_vendor`, `filament_type`, `name`) and the
`filaments` claiming it (`Vendor/Filament`), and it sanctions *state*, never exceptions: no check
consults it to excuse a preset from a rule, and there is no grandfather list of any kind.

The checks, in brief:

- **Format** — every id occurring in the tree is `OF` + 6 base62 chars. No exceptions: not a
  snapshot entry, not BBL.
- **Snapshot equality** — tree claims == snapshot claims **and** each id's declared triple ==
  its snapshot entry, both directions: any `filament_vendor`/`filament_type`/name change
  surfaces as a snapshot diff.
- **Identity** — the id is a function of the triple alone. A declared `OF*` id must equal the
  one id its declarer's own triple mints, with no second acceptable value; the id an
  instantiated preset *inherits* must equal the mint of *its* own triple, however it inherits
  it (a root, a real filament, a library preset — structure rule 1); and every instantiated
  system filament must resolve an effective id at all (recall: an id-less one is a hard load
  error in C++ that discards the whole vendor bundle); and no two products mint one id (a
  base62 collision, resolved by renaming one of them). The errors print the expected id.
- **Reserved namespaces** — `GF*`, `QD_*`, `P<7-hex>` or `"null"` claimed by any vendor,
  BBL and Qidi included.
- **Triple integrity** — every declarer must resolve a non-empty `filament_vendor` and
  `filament_type` (generics use `"Generic"`), and all declarers of one filament within a
  bundle must agree on the triple.
- **Bambu catalog map** — `resources/printers/bambu_filament_ids.json` parses, carries its
  `source` / `bambustudio_commit` / `generated` header, keys only `OF`-format ids, maps each
  Bambu id at most once, and agrees with the tree on the triple of every row whose key the
  tree claims. See [The Bambu catalog map](#the-bambu-catalog-map); the remedy is always to
  regenerate, never to hand-edit.

A profile that declares a **reserved-namespace** id — `GF*`, `QD_*` or `P<7-hex>`, whatever
its vendor — cannot pass the format check, so `--update-snapshot` refuses to sanction it
rather than hide the mistake until CI. For a Bambu-cataloged product, the catalog map is where
the correspondence belongs. Any other new sharing via a *declared* id is caught by the identity
check; sharing through inheritance carries no declaration to check and surfaces only as a new
claim in the snapshot diff — which is exactly why that diff is the gate.

`orca_extra_profile_check.py` separately holds every declared id to the AMS 8-character limit,
tree-wide and for every vendor alike, scoped to the presets a vendor's index actually
references (a file the index never loads cannot break AMS matching).

Complementing the Python checks, CI also runs the C++ profile validator with `-f`
(`check_filament_subtypes`): it loads the bundle exactly as the app does and flags any printer
for which two or more compatible filament presets share one `filament_id` — the runtime-shaped
ambiguity check behind structure rule 3.

## FAQ

- **A new color of an existing product?** Never a new id — colors are not filaments.
- **A second diameter (1.75 mm and 2.85 mm) of the same product?** A sibling filament with its
  own id: two diameters are separately selectable spool products.
- **A high-speed tune of an existing material for another printer model?** Same filament:
  keep the base name and inherit its root; no id key needed.
- **A tuned generic ("our profile for Generic PLA")?** Inherit `Generic PLA @System`, keep the
  `Generic PLA` base name, set `compatible_printers`; no id key needed.
- **A branded filament that borrows a generic's settings?** Fine — inherit `Generic X @System`
  (or any real filament) for the settings and declare the id of your own filament; run
  `python scripts/orca_id_tool.py --generate` to mint it. Inheritance never changes the id.
- **I need to fix a filament's `filament_vendor` or `filament_type`.** Fix the config, run
  `--generate --vendor <Vendor>` (preview with `--dry-run`), then `--update-snapshot`, and commit
  the profile and snapshot diffs together. The id re-derives from the corrected identity, and
  nothing forwards the old value, so a tray or record still holding it falls back to matching by
  filament type.
- **I need to rename a filament.** Rename the presets (adding `renamed_from`, which keeps the
  preset *name* resolving), then `--generate --vendor <Vendor>` (preview with `--dry-run`), then
  `--update-snapshot`. The id follows the new filament name; as with any identity fix, the old id
  is not forwarded.
- **Can I reuse a `QD_*` id for a Qidi profile?** No — nobody can. It is the device protocol's
  own id space: the box composes those values at runtime and no preset carries one. Author
  Qidi filaments like any other vendor's.
- **CI says my filament needs an id.** Run `python scripts/orca_id_tool.py --generate`, then
  `--update-snapshot`, and commit both diffs. Do not type an id by hand.
