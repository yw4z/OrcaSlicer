# Precise Seam — High Level Design

## Purpose and scope

Precise Seam lets a helper volume decide where the seam of an object goes. The
user attaches a mesh to an object as a Precise Seam modifier. On every layer,
the part of the external perimeter that lies inside the modifier's slice
determines where the seam must, may or must not be placed. The helper is a
persistent model object rather than paint on the surface, so it keeps working
when the design changes. A body swept along a path on the surface can guide the
seam along any trajectory.

The modifier is non-printing geometry. It takes no part in object slicing,
region assignment, filament selection or brim adhesion, and it affects only seam
placement during G-code export. Objects without Precise Seam volumes follow the
regular seam placement unchanged.

Precise Seam does not replace the seam placer. It feeds it: a modifier inserts
the points it needs into the perimeter and changes the enforced/blocked type of
seam candidates, the same typing mechanism as seam painting, and the configured
seam position then chooses among them.

## Modifier types

Precise Seam adds six `ModelVolumeType` values after `SUPPORT_ENFORCER`, strong
types first and weak types after them. `is_precise_seam()`,
`is_precise_seam_strong()` and `is_precise_seam_weak()` are range checks that
depend on this order.

| Type | Group | Effect on an intersected perimeter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PRECISE_SEAM_CENTER` | strong | seam at the midpoint, by arc length, of the intersection |
| `PRECISE_SEAM_LEFT` | strong | seam at the first point of the intersection |
| `PRECISE_SEAM_RIGHT` | strong | seam at the last point of the intersection |
| `PRECISE_SEAM_ENFORCED` | weak | intersection marked as enforced |
| `PRECISE_SEAM_BLOCKED` | weak | intersection marked as blocked |
| `PRECISE_SEAM_NEUTRAL` | weak | intersection reset to neutral |

A strong modifier fixes a single point. The perimeter gets exactly one enforced
seam candidate there, and every other candidate is blocked. A weak modifier
retypes, and where needed adds, the candidates inside its intersection, like
painting does.

An **intersection** is a continuous part of the external perimeter's centerline
that lies inside the modifier's slice on that layer. It is a portion of the
perimeter, never a chord through the object. The centerline lies half an
extrusion width inside the model surface and depends on print settings, so a
modifier must reach clearly past the surface to cross it unambiguously.

### Terms

- **Segment:** an intersection as the code represents it (`PerimeterSegment`).
  User-facing texts call it an intersection.
- **Fragment:** a piece of the perimeter returned by clipping, before it is tied
  to the source contour.
- **Interval:** the bound part of one source edge, given by the edge index and a
  parameter range on that edge.
- **Zone:** a weak segment with its type (Enforced, Blocked or Neutral).
- **Boundary:** an end of a zone, inserted into the perimeter polygon.
- **Candidate:** a seam candidate of the seam placer, built from the points of
  the processed perimeter polygon (painted enforcers may add more).

First and last are taken along the perimeter oriented counter-clockwise as seen
from above. On an outer wall seen from outside, Left is therefore the left end
of the intersection. On the wall of a hole seen from inside the hole, the two
ends are swapped. Mirroring an object does not mirror the mode: perimeters stay
counter-clockwise, so Left remains the left end seen from outside, and the seam
moves to the other end of the modifier instead of following the mirrored model.

## Priority

The order of volumes in the object is the priority order, highest first.
`ModelObject::sort_volumes()` keeps every strong modifier before every weak one
and preserves the user's order within each group. The object list lets the user
drag a modifier only within its own group. A type change that crosses the group
boundary moves the volume to the end of its new group, with the lowest priority
there.

- **Strong:** modifiers are tried in priority order on each perimeter. The first
  one that yields a usable segment decides the seam. Within that modifier the
  longest segment wins; lengths are never compared across modifiers. Once a
  strong point is placed, no later strong modifier and no weak modifier is
  processed for that perimeter.
- **Weak:** every weak modifier applies. They are applied from the lowest
  priority to the highest, so the highest one overwrites overlapping zones. A
  Blocked modifier that fully contains a perimeter is the exception: it is
  skipped there (see [Full containment](#full-containment)).

A strong modifier without a usable segment, even one whose fragments were all
discarded, passes the turn to the next one.

## Data flow

1. **Invalidation.** `Print::apply()` treats a change of Precise Seam volumes as
   a change of seam placement and invalidates G-code export; the object is not
   resliced (see [Print invalidation](#print-invalidation)).
2. **Modifier slices.** `SeamPlacer::init()` collects each object's Precise Seam
   volumes once, slices every volume separately and caches its regions with
   their bounding boxes.
3. **Perimeters.** Seam candidates are gathered in parallel over the layers.
   For objects with Precise Seam volumes, each external perimeter polygon is
   normalized and prepared once for all modifiers.
4. **Extraction.** For each modifier, the perimeter is clipped against the
   modifier's regions on that layer. The clipped fragments are bound back to the
   source edges of the perimeter and assembled into segments.
5. **Strong, then weak.** Strong modifiers try to insert one seam point into the
   perimeter polygon. If none succeeds, weak modifiers insert their zone
   boundaries and subdivide enforced edges.
6. **Candidates.** The seam placer builds candidates from the modified polygon.
   Painting assigns types first, weak zones overwrite them, and a strong point
   makes its candidate the only enforced one.
7. **Selection and restoration.** The configured seam position chooses the
   seams and aligns them. Afterwards the exact strong points are restored.
8. **Warnings.** After all objects are processed, `SeamPlacer::init()` prepares
   one combined warning text if any problem was found; G-code export issues it.

## Modifier slices

`init_precise_seam_data()` collects the Precise Seam volumes of each object:
strong ones in priority order and weak ones in reverse, so that weak zones can
be applied with last-write-wins. Each volume is sliced separately with
`PrintObject::slice_single_volume_regions()`, at the object's layer heights and
with the same centered transformation as the object. The slices keep every
region's outer contour together with its holes as an `ExPolygon`. Volumes are
not merged, so each keeps its own priority, and a modifier may have several
regions on one layer.

`prepare_modifier_slices()` moves the slices into `ModifierRegionsCache`,
pairing each region with the bounding box of its exterior. Empty layers keep
their slots, so the cache is indexed by object layer; `Layer::id()` includes raft
layers, which are subtracted. The cache is filled before candidates are gathered
and is only read afterwards, shared by both modifier kinds and all worker
threads without locking.

## Perimeter preparation

The seam placer works on external perimeter loops, including the walls of
holes. For objects with Precise Seam volumes, consecutive duplicate points and
the repeated closing point of each extrusion loop are removed: adjacent
extrusion paths share endpoints, and the resulting zero-length edges would
prevent point insertion at their junctions. Distinct visits to one point of a
self-touching contour are kept. Objects without Precise Seam volumes keep their
original points, so ordinary seam candidates are unaffected.

Each polygon is made counter-clockwise. A single `PreparedPerimeter` is then
built for all modifiers of that perimeter. It holds a validity check (at least
three points, no consecutive or closing duplicates), the bounding box, and the
clipping line: the polygon as an open polyline with its first point repeated at
the end. The preparation borrows the polygon and is used only while the polygon
is unchanged: strong processing returns immediately after inserting its point,
and weak processing collects all segments before it inserts anything. An
invalid perimeter receives no Precise Seam processing.

## Segment extraction

`extract_perimeter_segments()` turns one modifier's regions on one layer into
segments of the perimeter, each with its geometry and its position on the
source contour. Both modifier kinds consume these segments; the extractor is
told the modifier type so that it prepares only the data that type needs.

### Clipping

Regions whose bounding box does not overlap the perimeter's are skipped. The
clipping line is intersected with each remaining region by `intersection_pl()`,
which clips an open path against an `ExPolygon` with its holes attached, using
the nonzero rule. Clipping an open line yields only pieces of the perimeter, so
a modifier crossing the whole object produces two separate pieces rather than a
chord through the body. Holes in a modifier and several regions of one modifier
simply produce more pieces. The line is cut at vertex zero, so a piece crossing
that vertex arrives as two fragments. A border that only touches the line can
come back as a single point; such fragments carry no coverage and are dropped
before binding.

### Binding fragments to source edges

Clipper returns coordinates only. Insertion needs the source edge of every
point, and coordinates alone are ambiguous where a contour visits the same
point twice. Each fragment is therefore bound to the source edges it covers,
producing intervals: an edge index with a parameter range on that edge.

- **Exact path.** For fragments with interior points, the second point is used
  as an anchor that must equal a source vertex exactly. Clipping keeps the
  vertices of an open path unchanged, including collinear ones. The following
  points must match successive source vertices in either direction; later
  occurrences of the anchor are tried if a sequence does not match. Only the two
  end cuts are projected onto their edges.
- **Projection path.** Two-point fragments, and fragments the exact path cannot
  match, are bound by projection. The first source edge that holds both points
  of the first pair, with distinct parameters, establishes the edge and
  direction. Every following pair must continue on the same edge or cross to the
  neighboring edge at their actual shared vertex, in the same direction. A pair
  continuing on the same edge reuses the previous pair's parameter for their
  shared point, so the two projections of one point cannot differ.
- **Failure.** A fragment that cannot be bound continuously is rolled back and
  discarded. Earlier fragments and other fragments are unaffected. The failure
  is counted, logged and reported to the user (see
  [Diagnostics](#diagnostics-and-warnings)).

Two rare rounding cases are handled only after both paths have failed, so the
normal path never pays for them:

- **Cut beside a vertex.** When a modifier boundary crosses within about one
  coordinate unit of a source vertex, Clipper can place the cut at the vertex's
  height but a few units beside it. The end pair then collapses to the vertex's
  parameter or misses both neighboring edges. An end cut closer than the
  snapping radius to a vertex of the fragment's own chain is snapped to that
  vertex: either its neighbor in the fragment (the cut is a rounded copy of it
  and is dropped) or a vertex that shares a source edge with that neighbor. The
  neighbor wins whenever it is within the radius. Ends that are themselves source
  vertices and ambiguous choices are left unchanged. Binding is then retried
  once with the same strict rules, so a wrong candidate can only fail again.
- **Contact.** A fragment that still fails but is shorter than the snapping
  radius is accepted as a contact and binds nothing. Insertion would collapse it
  onto one point anyway.

Both outcomes are recoveries, not failures: they show no user warning but leave
a log marker.

### Assembling segments

The intervals are sorted by edge and parameter. Intervals on the same occurrence
of an edge are united when they overlap or meet, by parameter or at the same
integer point; equal coordinates on different edges are never united. A
parameter of 1 is stored as parameter 0 of the next edge, so intervals on
adjacent edges meet exactly at their shared vertex. Consecutive intervals that
meet form one `PerimeterSegment`, and the last segment is joined with the first
when they meet at vertex zero, undoing the artificial cut of the clipping line.

Each segment keeps its polyline, the source edge of every polyline edge, and its
begin and end positions on the source contour.

### Full containment

A modifier that covers the whole perimeter has no boundaries on it. The policy
follows seam painting, where painting a whole perimeter green is a meaningful
choice and forbidding the seam all round is not:

- **Seam Enforced** types the whole perimeter, like a perimeter painted green all
  round, with subdivision applied as described under [Weak modifiers](#weak-modifiers).
- **Seam Neutral** types the whole perimeter Neutral, like an unmarked perimeter,
  clearing painting and lower zones.
- **Seam Blocked** is skipped for the perimeter, with the full-containment
  warning. The seam cannot avoid the whole perimeter, so the modifier does not
  override anything below it: lower zones and painting stay in effect.
- **Seam Center, Left and Right** are skipped with the same warning: there is no
  intersection to place the point on.

Enforced and Neutral take part in the usual priority order (see
[Weak modifiers](#weak-modifiers)).

The perimeter is fully contained when the united intervals cover every source
edge from parameter 0 to 1. A modifier boundary that merely touches the
perimeter counts as well:

- At a vertex or on an axis-aligned edge, clipping splits the line exactly at the
  touch, the pieces meet at one point, and the coverage is complete.
- On an inclined edge the touching point is usually not representable on the
  integer grid. The boundary pokes a few units across and leaves a real gap, so
  a single segment covers everything except that gap.

Weak insertion would collapse such a segment's boundaries onto one vertex and
turn the intended zone into a single candidate, and strong would put the seam at
the touch. A single segment is therefore also full containment in the cases
where insertion collapses it, exactly up to edges shorter than 2 µm:

- the uncovered length from its end to its begin is below 1 µm, or
- the gap spans one vertex, or starts at a vertex and ends on the next edge, and
  both ends lie within 1 µm of the vertex that ends the first gap edge, since
  each end then snaps onto it from its own edge.

A cheap filter runs first: both cases bring the segment's ends within 2 µm of
each other.

## Strong modifiers

For a strong modifier, the extractor prepares each segment's target point
before anything is inserted, together with the source edge it lies on:

- **Left:** the segment's first point.
- **Right:** the segment's last point.
- **Center:** the point at half the segment's arc length.

Arc length is the sum of Euclidean edge lengths, not the chord or a vertex count.

`insert_strong_seam_point()` selects the longest segment of the first modifier
that has one. Exactly equal lengths are resolved by the prepared target points:
greater bed Y first, then smaller X; a complete tie keeps the first segment.
Slice coordinates already include instance rotation and have the bed axes;
centering and XY translation do not change this order. Nearly equal lengths are
not treated as equal, so exact ties occur mainly on axis-aligned geometry.
Geometrically equal segments, such as a symmetric modifier crossing both faces
of a thin wall, differ only by rounding noise that varies between layers, so
the chosen face may alternate. This is accepted deliberately: such a modifier is
ambiguous by itself: more than one segment raises the "multiple intersections"
warning. The user should make the modifier cross the perimeter once.

The selected point is inserted on its source edge. A point within 1 µm of an
existing vertex is snapped to that vertex. Helper points are added 1 µm on both
sides of it, except on an adjacent edge shorter than 2 µm, which already bounds
the distance.

When the candidates are built, the candidate at the inserted point is the only
enforced one and becomes the central enforcer; every other candidate is blocked.
Every seam position mode therefore selects it. Alignment and random placement
can still move the final position, so after alignment
`restore_precise_seam_positions()` writes the exact point and its index back
into every perimeter that has a strong seam.

## Weak modifiers

`collect_weak_modifier_segments()` extracts the segments of every weak modifier
before the polygon is modified, so all positions refer to the same contour. Each
segment becomes a zone with a type and two boundaries, kept in application
order, lowest priority first. Full containment of an Enforced or Neutral
modifier becomes a whole-perimeter zone at its place in that order: it has no
boundaries and takes part in no insertion or helper step below. The boundaries
carry their positions on the source contour; these remain as provenance after
insertion and are not indices into the modified polygon.

`prepare_weak_modifier_segments()` then changes the polygon:

1. **Boundary insertion.** Insertion events are sorted by decreasing source edge
   and parameter, and the polygon is modified from its end towards its start. A
   pending boundary's source index therefore stays valid. Vertex zero has the
   canonical position `(0, 0)` and is
   processed last, and a point on the closing edge is appended rather than
   inserted at index zero. A boundary within 1 µm of either endpoint of its
   current edge, an original vertex or a boundary inserted earlier, is snapped to
   that point, so coincident boundaries share a vertex. A zone narrower than
   1 µm collapses into a single vertex.
2. **Helper points.** A helper point is added 1 µm outside every boundary,
   unless the edge there is shorter than 2 µm, which already bounds it. The
   helpers keep the edges at a boundary short, so a seam placed along such an
   edge stays close to the boundary. Coincident boundaries share their helpers.
3. **Enforced subdivision.** Zone types are resolved for the polygon's edges in
   priority order. The edges of a zone are those from its left boundary up to,
   but not including, its right boundary; a whole-perimeter zone types every
   edge. Enforced edges longer than `SeamPlacer::enforcer_oversampling_distance`
   (0.2 mm) are subdivided into steps of at most that length; shorter edges and
   existing vertices are kept.
   The regular seam placer then chooses the seam as for painted seams.

When candidates are built, painting assigns their types first.
`apply_weak_modifiers_to_perimeter()` then overwrites the types of the
candidates between the boundaries of each zone, both boundaries included,
lowest priority first; a whole-perimeter zone types every candidate. Blocked
and Enforced zones therefore take precedence over painting, and Neutral clears
painting inside its zone.

## Numeric tolerances

Coordinates are integers in scaled units: 1 nm by default, and 10 nm when a bed
larger than 2147 mm switches `SCALING_FACTOR`. Both Precise Seam tolerances are
deliberately defined in units rather than physical distances. Clipper truncates
cuts to whole units at any scale, so the on-edge tolerance must follow the unit; the
snapping radius scales with it to keep its margin over single-precision
candidate coordinates, which are coarser on large beds. Distances quoted in
this document in nanometers and
micrometers assume the default unit; on large printers they are ten times
larger. The enforced subdivision step is a physical distance and stays 0.2 mm.

| Value | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `MACHINE_PRECISION_SQUARED` (2.5 units², about 1.6 nm) | A point lies on an edge if it is this close. It absorbs Clipper's truncation of cuts to whole units (under √2 units from the edge) and never bridges a real gap: a one-unit uncovered gap stays a gap. |
| `TOLERANCE_LINEAR` (1000 units, 1 µm) | Insertion snaps points this close to an existing vertex, and helper points are placed this far from boundaries. The same radius bounds the rounding fallback, contacts and the sub-micron full-containment rule, so those decisions match what insertion would produce anyway. |
| `enforcer_oversampling_distance` (0.2 mm) | Maximum step of enforced subdivision. |

Raising the on-edge tolerance would not help with cuts beside a vertex: more
points past a vertex would be clamped to its parameter and collapse. Lowering it
would reject ordinary rounded cuts. The snapping radius is kept far above
clipping precision for robustness: seam candidates hold single-precision
coordinates, whose step is about 8 to 15 nm at typical object coordinates
(about 0.25 µm 3 m from the object's centre, on large beds only), and
weak boundaries and the strong point are located among the candidates by those
coordinates, so distinct points must stay clearly distinct. 1 µm is also far
below printing precision.

## Diagnostics and warnings

One `PreciseSeamWarnings` instance is shared by all objects and layers of a
`SeamPlacer::init()` call. After all objects are processed, `SeamPlacer::init()`
prepares at most one warning text, available through `precise_seam_warning()`.
G-code export issues it as one non-critical warning with the ID
`SlicingPreciseSeamWarning`. It is a single line, "Precise Seam: <causes>. Seam
placement may differ from expected.", because the export warnings dialog shows
only the first line of each warning. Repeated warning events replace the
notification instead of appending to it. Except for the "had no effect" cause,
the causes name the modifier types involved, as the menu names them, in menu
order and each type once, for example "(Seam Left, Seam Enforced)".
The causes are:

- **failed to process some intersections (types):** at least one fragment was
  discarded by binding. Other segments remain usable.
- **multiple intersections with a perimeter, only one was used (types):**
  a Seam Center, Left or Right modifier had more than one segment on a
  perimeter (see [Strong modifiers](#strong-modifiers)).
- **a perimeter is fully inside a modifier, the modifier was not applied to it
  (types):** a Seam Center, Left, Right or Blocked modifier was skipped for a
  perimeter (see [Full containment](#full-containment)).
- **modifier "<name>" of "<object>" had no effect on the seam (it might not reach
  the centerline of the printed perimeter):** a modifier was evaluated on at
  least one perimeter and never gave a segment, full containment or a discarded
  fragment. Only the first such modifier in print and volume order is named,
  followed by "(N in total)" when there are several.

  Only the effect is certain, so the cause is given as a hint. A modifier is
  evaluated only when its turn comes: on a perimeter where a higher strong
  modifier placed the seam, lower strong and all weak modifiers are not
  evaluated. A modifier that was never evaluated is not reported, since nothing
  is known about it. A point contact gives no segment and does not count as
  reaching the perimeter.

The log records the following diagnostic markers:

- `[PreciseSeamIntersectionFailed]` for a discarded fragment, with object,
  modifier, layer, height, fragment and failing pair, the failure reason and
  point counts.
- `[PreciseSeamFragmentRecovered]` for a recovery, with `outcome=bound` or
  `outcome=contact`, the same location fields and the original failure reason.
- `[PreciseSeamNoEffect]` for every modifier of the "had no effect" cause, with
  the object and modifier names. Unlike the user warning, the log lists all of
  them.

Failures and recoveries are counted separately. The first 10 of each per
`init()` call are logged in detail, in parallel processing order; if a limit is
exceeded, one summary marker reports the total and the number omitted.

## Known limitations

- **The modifier must reach the perimeter centerline.** Contacts are taken as
  clipping returns them, without offsets or tangency rules, so boundaries that
  only graze the centerline are the user's responsibility. Several near-touches
  on inclined edges can leave several segments separated by gaps of a few units;
  their zones then cover nearly the whole perimeter instead of being treated as
  full containment.
- **Self-touching perimeters.** Extraction keeps distinct visits of one
  coordinate apart through its source-edge bindings, but the consumers locate
  inserted points by coordinates. A weak zone is typed and subdivided from the
  first vertex with its boundary coordinate, while boundary helpers are added at
  every such vertex. A strong point marks every candidate at its coordinate as
  enforced, and the last one is restored after alignment. If a boundary or a
  strong point falls exactly on a repeated coordinate, a zone may therefore start
  from another visit, or the seam may start at another visit of the same point.
  Carrying visit identity through insertion, refinement, candidates and
  restoration would touch the whole pipeline, so it is not done for this rare
  geometry. Overlapping source visits are likewise outside the binding contract.

## Integration with the application

### Other seam settings

- Precise Seam takes part only in outer and hole perimeter seam placement. In
  spiral vase mode the seam placer is not used for perimeters, so the modifiers
  have no effect.
- Scarf seams, the seam gap and wiping start from the chosen point exactly as
  they would from an ordinary seam.
- Seam painting acts only from model parts, the volumes the seam gizmo shows and
  edits, and from negative volumes. Painting retained on a volume after a change
  from part to a Precise Seam, ordinary or support modifier is ignored. A type
  change back to a model part reactivates any retained painting.
  Negative volumes keep it on purpose: painting a
  part and turning it into a negative volume is the only way to paint the wall
  of the hole it cuts. That painting still affects the seam but is invisible in
  the gizmo and cannot be edited there; this is known technical debt.
  If painting them is ever made editable, G-code invalidation must track it too:
  `model_custom_seam_data_changed()` checks model parts only.

### Model storage and 3MF compatibility

Projects must stay readable by earlier releases, and a Precise Seam volume must
not change a print there. Both 3MF writers therefore store it as an ordinary
parameter modifier: `modifier_part` in the Bambu-format part subtype, and
`ParameterModifier` together with the legacy `modifier` flag in the
Prusa-format volume metadata. The seam mode is written separately under
`precise_seam_type`, using the names from `ModelVolume::type_to_string()`
(`precise_seam_center` and so on).

On load, the mode is applied after all other volume metadata, regardless of XML
key order, and only when the base type is a modifier. A missing or unknown mode
leaves an ordinary modifier, and seam metadata on any other base type is
ignored. Files that stored the seam mode directly as the volume type still load.
A project saved again by an earlier release loses the seam mode for good: the
volumes stay ordinary modifiers without settings.

A Precise Seam volume keeps any per-volume settings it had as a part or
modifier, but they are inactive and the object list shows no settings item for
it. The writers prefix these keys with `precise_seam_config:`, so an earlier
reader drops them as unknown options and loads a modifier without settings,
which has no effect on the print. The current reader restores the keys only when
the volume ends up as a Precise Seam type, so the settings return when the user
changes the type back.

### Print invalidation

`Print::apply()` compares the Precise Seam volumes of each object by type, ID
and transformation. Adding, removing, moving, reordering or retyping one cancels
background processing and invalidates only `psGCodeExport`; the sliced layers
are kept. `model_volume_list_update_supports_and_seams()` then brings the
support and Precise Seam volumes of the print's model copy in line with the new
model in one pass. A volume may switch between these two families, since neither
affects object slicing; such a switch also changes the support volumes, so the
support step is invalidated as well.

A conversion to or from a part or an ordinary modifier changes the solid and
modifier volume lists and reslices the object as before. The volume keeps its
ID across the type change, so the region cache treats a former support or
Precise Seam volume that became a part or modifier as new, since it was never
cached.

Removing the last helper of a single-part object reslices it, as removing any
last modifier would.

### User interface

- *Add Precise Seam* in the object menu creates a Center modifier from a
  primitive or a loaded mesh. Text and SVG volumes cannot become Precise Seam
  modifiers: the menu does not offer it, and `ObjectList::set_volume_type()`
  refuses the change.
- *Change Type* has a single *Precise Seam* entry. It converts other volumes to
  Center and keeps the mode of volumes that are already Precise Seam. The
  *Precise Seam Type* submenu appears only when every selected item is a Precise
  Seam volume, including settings rows that resolve to one, and sets the chosen
  mode on all of them.
- Each mode has its own icon in the object list and its own color in the 3D
  view, at 60% opacity: warm orange, gold and dark orange for Center, Left and
  Right; green, red and gray for Enforced, Blocked and Neutral. The three strong
  colors are close shades of one orange because all three mark strong
  modifiers; the object list icons tell the modes apart.
- Precise Seam volumes have no filament and cannot be pasted into SLA objects.
  Python plugins see them as `ModelVolumeType` values and through the
  `is_precise_seam*()` methods.

## Implementation and verification

- [PreciseSeam.cpp](../../src/libslic3r/GCode/PreciseSeam.cpp) implements the
  modifier cache, perimeter preparation, segment extraction and binding, strong
  selection and insertion, weak-zone preparation and application, and position
  restoration. [PreciseSeam.hpp](../../src/libslic3r/GCode/PreciseSeam.hpp)
  declares the contracts; [PreciseSeamInternal.hpp](../../src/libslic3r/GCode/PreciseSeamInternal.hpp)
  exposes the binding internals to tests.
- [SeamPlacer.cpp](../../src/libslic3r/GCode/SeamPlacer.cpp) fills the cache,
  normalizes perimeters, calls both consumers while gathering candidates,
  restores strong positions after alignment and prepares the warning text, which
  [GCode.cpp](../../src/libslic3r/GCode.cpp) issues during G-code export.
- [Model.hpp](../../src/libslic3r/Model.hpp) defines the types and their order,
  [PrintApply.cpp](../../src/libslic3r/PrintApply.cpp) handles invalidation, and
  [PrintObjectSlice.cpp](../../src/libslic3r/PrintObjectSlice.cpp) slices single
  volumes into structured regions. [bbs_3mf.cpp](../../src/libslic3r/Format/bbs_3mf.cpp)
  and [3mf.cpp](../../src/libslic3r/Format/3mf.cpp) store them.
- [GUI_Factories.cpp](../../src/slic3r/GUI/GUI_Factories.cpp) and
  [GUI_ObjectList.cpp](../../src/slic3r/GUI/GUI_ObjectList.cpp) provide the menus,
  type changes and ordering; [3DScene.cpp](../../src/slic3r/GUI/3DScene.cpp)
  defines the colors.
- [Segment extraction tests](../../tests/libslic3r/test_precise_seam.cpp) cover
  clipping and binding: holes and components, contour origin and reversal,
  repeated coordinates, collinear vertices and rounding, rollback and the
  diagnostic limits, the rounding fallback on synthetic and real Clipper
  fragments, contacts, and full containment including touches and sub-micron
  gaps on inclined edges and around vertices.
- [Precise Seam tests](../../tests/fff_print/test_precise_seam.cpp) cover the
  consumers: strong targets in every mode, including a midpoint on an existing
  vertex or the closing edge, longest-arc selection and tie order in bed axes,
  priorities, weak boundaries that coincide or share an edge, enforced
  subdivision, whole-perimeter weak zones with painting and priorities, weak
  zones over painting's oversampled candidates, the warning type masks, usage
  tracking for the "had no effect" warning, volume sorting of strong and weak
  groups, restoration of strong points after alignment, raft layer indexing and
  structured slices. End-to-end tests slice a real object with Precise Seam
  volumes and check the outer wall starts in the exported G-code: every strong
  mode under several seam positions and with a raft, Enforced and Blocked zones,
  a modifier with a hole, and the user warning.
- [Seam placer tests](../../tests/fff_print/test_seam_placer.cpp) cover
  enforced-patch selection independent of the contour start, fully painted
  contours, duplicate removal, and `Print::apply()` synchronization through type
  changes and restored model snapshots. The duplicate-removal test also checks
  the "had no effect" warning text prepared by `init()` for a helper that never
  reaches the loop. Further tests check that adding, moving, retyping or
  removing a Precise Seam volume invalidates only G-code export, and that seam
  painting acts only from model parts and negative volumes, including after a
  type change back to part.
- [3MF tests](../../tests/libslic3r/test_precise_seam_3mf.cpp) cover the round
  trip of every mode and of inactive settings, attribute escaping, and the
  metadata combinations that restore a seam mode.
  [Plugin tests](../../tests/slic3rutils/test_precise_seam_plugin.cpp) cover the
  Python bindings.
