"""Emit the C++ offer table from docs/ux/tool_atlas.json.

    python3 docs/ux/mockups/gen_offer_table.py

The map exists ONCE. The mockups and the shipping menu read the same rows in the same
order from the same file, so a drawing and the product cannot drift apart — which is the
only way row constancy (charter 4.1) survives contact with a codebase.

Output: src/slic3r/GUI/CAD/DesignOffer.hpp, checked in and never hand-edited.
