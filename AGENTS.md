# CLAUDE.md

OrcaSlicer — open-source C++17 3D slicer. wxWidgets GUI, CMake build system.

## Build Commands

```bash
# macOS
cmake --build build/arm64 --config RelWithDebInfo --target all --

# Linux
cmake --build build --config RelWithDebInfo --target all --

# Windows (replace %build_type% with Debug/Release/RelWithDebInfo)
cmake --build . --config %build_type% --target ALL_BUILD -- -m
```

## Testing

Catch2 framework. Tests in `tests/`; see [tests/AGENTS.md](tests/AGENTS.md) for where a new test belongs and the conventions to follow.

```bash
cd build && ctest --output-on-failure           # all tests
ctest --test-dir ./tests/libslic3r              # individual suite
ctest --test-dir ./tests/fff_print
```

## Code Style

- C++17, selective C++20. PascalCase classes, snake_case functions/variables
- `#pragma once` for headers. Smart pointers and RAII preferred
- Parallelization via TBB — be mindful of shared state
- Always use `SetSizerAndFit(sizer)` instead of `SetSizer(sizer)` on top level window. Unless `SetSizer` must be called before the full layout is built, call `sizer->SetSizeHints(window)` afterwards in this case.

## Key Entry Points

- App startup: `src/OrcaSlicer.cpp`
- Slicing pipeline: `src/libslic3r/Print.cpp`
- All print/printer/material settings: `src/libslic3r/PrintConfig.cpp`
- GUI: `src/slic3r/GUI/`
- Core algorithms: `src/libslic3r/` (GCode/, Fill/, Support/, Geometry/, Format/, Arachne/)
- Printer profiles: `resources/profiles/[manufacturer].json`

## Critical Constraints

- **Backward compatibility required** for .3mf project files and printer profiles
- **Cross-platform** — all changes must work on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Profile/format changes need version migration handling
- Dependencies built separately in `deps/build/`, then linked to main app

## Code review focus areas

- Changes must not cause regressions in existing functionality, defaults, profiles, or project compatibility.
- Features gated by options must not affect existing behavior when those options are disabled.
- Changes should follow the existing code style and architecture. Architectural changes should be justified in code comments and the PR description.
- Add helper functions or utilities only when existing code cannot reasonably be reused. Avoid duplication.
- Keep code concise and clear. Manually simplify AI generated bloated codes before review.
- Include targeted tests or documented verification for behavior changes, especially in slicing logic, profiles, formats, and GUI defaults.
- For profile changes (`resources/profiles/<Vendor>/**`), check that `version` in the sibling `resources/profiles/<Vendor>.json` was bumped.
- For translation changes (`localization/i18n/**/*.po`), check that recurring terms match the [Localization glossary](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer_WIKI/blob/main/guides/localization_glossary.md) for that language.

## Localization & translations

Catalogs live in `localization/i18n/<lang>/OrcaSlicer_<lang>.po`; the template is `OrcaSlicer.pot`.
See the [Localization guide](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer_WIKI/blob/main/guides/localization_guide.md) for the human-facing version of these principles.

### Terminology

- Use the [Localization glossary](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer_WIKI/blob/main/guides/localization_glossary.md) as the source of truth for recurring terms, so the same English term is always rendered the same way within a language, and terms that must stay in English (brand/product names, acronyms, materials, file formats, G-code tokens, macros/variables/identifiers) are not translated.
- If a term's established translation changes, update both the affected `.po` files and the glossary (`localization_glossary.tsv`, then regenerate) so they stay in sync.
- Translate the *meaning*, not the words. Check what the string actually controls before translating it — English reuses one word for different things. `Flow ratio` (multiplier), `Flow Rate` (throughput) and `Flow Dynamics` (pressure compensation) are three different terms; `extruder` may mean the toolhead, the feeder motor, or the nozzle depending on the string.
- Reuse one template per recurring message shape (`Failed to connect to …`, `Are you sure you want to …?`), even where the English wording varies.

### Editing rules

- Only edit `msgstr` — **never** change `msgid`, and never "fix" wrong English in the translation alone. Report the source string instead.
- Preserve exactly: placeholders (`%s`, `%d`, `%1%`, `%zu`, `%%`), every `\n` (count *and* position, including leading/trailing), leading/trailing spaces, HTML tags, `℃`, and the file's encoding and line endings.
- **Never reorder positional arguments** in a `c-format` string. If the msgid is `%d` then `%s`, that order must hold — swapping them breaks at runtime.
- `msgctxt` separates homonyms — always read it. `Back`/`Camera View` is the rear view of the 3D navigator, while `Back`/`Navigation` is the go-back button; `Top` exists in the *Alignment*, *Layers* and *Camera View* senses.
- When a string needs disambiguating, add context in the source (`_L_CONTEXT`/`_u8L_CONTEXT`), don't work around it in the translation.
- A literal `%` inside a string xgettext flagged `possible-c-format` will fail `msgfmt`. Fix it with a `// xgettext:no-c-format, no-boost-format` comment above the string in the source — do not mangle the translation or use `%%` in text that is never passed through printf.
- Plural entries: read `nplurals` from the catalog's `Plural-Forms` header (it is **not** always 2 — ja/ko/zh/th/vi use 1, ru/cs/pl/lt use 3, uk uses 4). Each form must be genuinely inflected for its quantity; repeating one sentence across all forms is a bug in Slavic/Baltic languages, though it is correct for Turkish and Hungarian.
- An entry whose `msgstr` equals its `msgid` is untranslated even though it is not empty; a plural entry with any empty form is likewise incomplete.
- Mark machine-produced translations with an `# AI Translated` translator comment. Don't add it to a human translation you didn't actually rewrite.
- Don't reflow or re-wrap unrelated entries — keep the diff limited to the strings you changed.

### Verifying

- `scripts/run_gettext.bat --full` (Windows) regenerates the template, merges every catalog and compiles the `.mo` files. It must exit 0.
- Or check a single catalog with `msgfmt --check-format -o <out>.mo localization/i18n/<lang>/OrcaSlicer_<lang>.po`.
- Fuzzy entries are not shown to users. If you correct one, clear its `fuzzy` flag, otherwise the fix never ships.
