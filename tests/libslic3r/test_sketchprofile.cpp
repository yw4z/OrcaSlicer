// Closed-profile harness for the 2D sketch layer.
//
// The existing [SketchEdit] cases check one entity at a time — offset ONE line, mirror ONE
// arc — and every one of them passes while the feature they belong to is unusable. What a
// user actually does is combine 2D features into a CLOSED PROFILE and extrude it, and the
// property that makes that work is topological, not per-entity: after the operation, do the
// pieces still form a single closed loop?
//
// So these cases assert the loop, not the coordinates. That is the invariant every sketch
// operation has to preserve and the only one that predicts whether the GUI can build a solid
// out of the result.
